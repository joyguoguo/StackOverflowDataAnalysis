    "title" : "Adding jgss security to my Android app which is using an old Java jtds jar",
    "body" : "<p>I've not used Android for years however I've returned to it, nice to see how updated Android Studio is with all of the Gradle and Kotlin stuff, as I've realised I need to package up some jtds using comms for talking to a remote OLAP cube.</p>\n<p>I stumbled across a good Youtube video and followed this / tweaked some steps as my AndroidStudio is more modern etc. I think I am getting it to connect as I hit a security libs issue, I think as the jtds is old (Java 8 I guess) and cannot find the required jgss class. Or does it matter about that and as long as I can add jgss to the project it will work?</p>\n<p>I'm seeing this error, after I added an implementation line to the gradle build file which in turn added a line to the toml.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pBWgldif.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pBWgldif.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>I've just messing around in the last hour and I know im close, just not used to this format (but used to this sort of thing as ive been developing since the 90s).</p>\n<p>I'd be grateful for someone more used to the current Android Studio and how I can get this added and see if it assists with progress.</p>\n<p>Many thanks</p>\n<p>Mr Leigh Tilley\n<a href=\"https://tilleytech.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://tilleytech.com</a></p>\n",
