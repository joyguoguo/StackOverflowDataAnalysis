Why ?</p>\n",

I'm not sure why you have nums1[p1] = 0; in there, it doesn't seem necessary.  Beyond that you can get into things on the hardware and interpreter level- the JIT cache guessing wrong on the branch prediction (or the hardware itself).  Locality issues in the cache maybe.  But its mostly going to be the extra instruction most likely.</p>\n<p>If you mean one or more of the &gt; in the while loop-  yeah, that adds more cases where the while loop runs.  More runs=more time.</p>\n<p>Although as I stated in a comment-  this is time to run, not time complexity.  None of these would change time complexity.</p>\n",
