With protocolling documentation.</p>\n<p>If you already doing logging for traceability, that would be just an extra step. Then in every process you could add an administrative info button to display how results are derived, the <strong>pipeline</strong> of value <strong>states</strong>, and <strong>rules</strong> applied.</p>\n<p>Similar pieces of code so may be tell how to refactor parts. Planning and communicating the refactoring and the progress are so easier.</p>\n<p><em>HOWEVER that is when you have a really large mess. Several hundred lines is not that much. <strong>Refactoring</strong> itself cannot be treated reasonably mature in stackoverflow here. Sorry.</em></p>\n",
