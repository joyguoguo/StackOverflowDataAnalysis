    "body" : "<p>I have two entities (A and B) which so far have been separate and unrelated. I now have a situation where there can be a single B associated with an A. I would like to set up Entity A so that when persisted, it will also persist Entity B (if one is defined), however I do not want any references on A to B or on B to A. Once persisted they should be completely independent and unrelated (so if I later load A, the field for B can be null). I need to be able to update and delete A and B independently once saved.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to setup the annotations to make this happen? <code>@OneToOne</code> seems to rely on there being some sort of join column or foreign key dependency, and <code>@OneToMany</code> requires that the property be a collection, which isn't correct for our model.</p>\n<p>My best approach right now seems to be mark B as <code>@Transient</code> on A and persist it separately, but it'd be nice to get it to all save in one go.</p>\n",
