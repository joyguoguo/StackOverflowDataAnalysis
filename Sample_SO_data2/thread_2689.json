    "body" : "<p>I have an Intellij project where I have 2 modules inside my project (names of those 2 modules are <code>cmdv3</code> and <code>functional-tests</code>). I'm trying to prevent my internal library classes from being exposed or used by the clients and for that I'm using <strong>module-info.java</strong>.</p>\n<p>All my code is inside the <code>cmdv3</code> module. Some of the classes in that module need to be accessed by all the clients. But some internal classes (like service layer, repository etc.) need to be hidden and made inaccessible to the users. I have a module-info.java where I specify which packages to export under <strong>src/main/java</strong> of the <code>cmdv3</code> module. It is something like</p>\n<pre><code>module cmdv3 {\n  exports controllers;\n  exports config;\n  exports definitions;\n  ......\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>where controllers, config, definitions etc. are all packages that I want to export and therefore make the classes of those packages accessible.</p>\n<p>Now in my functional-tests module, I have another <strong>module-info.java</strong> file that will use all the classes from the packages exported from cmdv3 module. That file looks like</p>\n<pre><code>module functional.tests {\n  requires cmdv3;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I try to run all my tests in the functional-tests module (just like how clients would use the code), I get an error from IntelliJ saying that <code>java: module not found: cmdv3</code></p>\n<p>My question is how can this be happening? When I was trying to write the <strong>module-info.java</strong> file of my functional-tests module, IntelliJ even gave me a suggestion after I typed <code>requires</code> to use the cmdv3 module.</p>\n<p>Has anyone run into this issue before where IntelliJ is not able to find the module if you have a <strong>module-info.java</strong> file? Everything was working fine until I added the <strong>module-info.java</strong> file to make only classes of certain packages accessible. Is there any other way that I can achieve this functionality without even having this <strong>module-info.java</strong> file? I cannot use the default access modifier for my classes in <code>cmdv3</code> module since a lot of those classes are used in other packages of the <code>cmdv3</code> module.</p>\n",
