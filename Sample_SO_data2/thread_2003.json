However, it did not generate Example.class. The previously generated example.class file is still present in the directory, and no new .class file was created.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is javac not generating Example.class even after changing the class name?</strong></p>\n<p>I expect that when I compile <em>Test.java</em> using <em>javac Test.java</em>, the generated .class file should match the class name defined inside the file — whether it's example or Example. But after changing the class name from example to Example and recompiling, <em>Example.class</em> was not generated, and only the old <em>example.class</em> file remained. Why is this happening?</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>Because you're on a case insensitive file system (such as macs, configured out of the box), and this kind of operation isn't supported. <code>javac</code> would have to have code to explicitly detect this exotic condition and act differently.</p>\n<p>You should file your complaints with your OS vendor, not with javac. Javac simply tells the OS &quot;I want to write to <code>Example.class</code> please&quot; and the OS is the one that 'messes this up' (it's actually specified behaviour) and instead opens a file handle to write to the already existing <code>example.class</code>.</p>\n<p>Javac would have to go out of its way to first ask the OS to delete the file before creating it, an extra step with extra potential issues <strong>only</strong> for this very specific case. Javac.. doesn't. Almost no tool does this.</p>\n",
