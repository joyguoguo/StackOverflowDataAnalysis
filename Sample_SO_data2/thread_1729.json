As long as the architecture is compatible the compiler should generally generate machine code that can be executable on an older but compatible processor. Then, the minSdk is a limit that you define that pertains to the software and not the hardware (processor).</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>Whenever you write Android code, you're prompted to place SDK version checks in case you're using any API that won't work on a certain SDK version that lies between your compile SDK and min SDK. This ensures that even when you're running an app on old devices, programmatically we don't call APIs that might not exist on that specific SDK version. In case you don't use such checks it can cause your app to crash.<br />\nAs an example consider the following:</p>\n<pre><code>if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE) {\n    // This API (e.g., predictive back) is only available on Android 14+\n    window.setOnBackInvokedDispatcher { /* ... */ }\n} else {\n    // Use legacy back press logic\n    onBackPressedDispatcher.addCallback(this) { /* ... */ }\n}\n</code></pre>\n",

So I would say that &quot;what determines how far one can go back&quot; are the presence of compatibility breaking changes between your targetSDK and minSDK. Usually when you adjust your minSDK lower and compile your app, you&#39;ll get a lot of warnings or errors regarding incompatible code that you must downgrade for the project to compile.
