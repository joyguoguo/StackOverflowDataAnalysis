    "title" : "Java project dependency jar - only part of new code being recognized",
    "body" : "<p>I have a Java service that relies on a dependency jar that I have modified. Within the dependency I have updated 2 different sections of code for unrelated functionality. I have updated the version of the jar and am including its use within the service via Maven.</p>\n<p>Within the service, when I run the code locally via IntelliJ that calls the dependency functionality I get:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The expected, new behavior for one of the code changes.</li>\n<li>Unexpected, previous behavior for the other code change. In this case, I have modified the value of a string that is being set when the code is invoked but the result is how the string was set in the old code.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My expectation is that using the new version of the jar will result in the use of the new code in both instances. StackOverflow closed my question and has asked that I provide code to reproduce the problem directly, but I'm not sure how I am supposed to do that since this is abnormal behavior.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The previous version:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Collections.sort(errorRecords);\nfe.setErrorMessage(&quot;Failed records - &quot; + errorRecords);\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>errorRecords</code> is a <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The new version:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>fe.setErrorMessage(&quot;Failed record(s) - please see documentation for remediation steps.&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>For troubleshooting I have done the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deleted all previous versions of the jar from the Maven m2 repo</li>\n<li>Performed <code>mvn clean install</code> on my service</li>\n<li>Verified that after the <code>mvn</code> call that the only version of the jar in the repo is the new one</li>\n<li>Invalidated IntelliJ cache - I am using version 2025.2.5 Ultimate</li>\n<li>Opened the packaged, new jar from the m2 repository to view the .class file, and confirmed my new code is present.</li>\n<li>Validated that the version of the jar being used by IntelliJ (in the External Libraries section) is the new version</li>\n<li>Attempted to view the code within IntelliJ. Unfortunately the method where my new code is cannot be decompiled by the Fern Flower decompiler in IntelliJ, so I cannot confirm the new code is present via stepping through the code via debugger. All I see there is <code>// $FF: Couldn't be decompiled</code> message. This is present when using older versions of the jar as well.</li>\n<li>Rebooted as a last resort. This is running on macOS 15.7.2. As expected, that didn't fix anything.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've run out of ideas of where to look next. Any thoughts?</p>\n",

In modifying and rebuilding the dependency, are you doing anything that would interfere with FernFlower&#39;s ability to decompile it?",
