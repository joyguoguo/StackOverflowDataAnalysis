    "body" : "<p>I'm a new Java programmer diving into learning Classes/Methods.   It <em>seems</em> like i've typed this code correctly but Java is throwing an error on the final class curly bracket (actual error says 'Syntax error on token '}',delete this token').   I've tried removing it, adding another one, cut and pasting the class's variables and methods into a new set of curly braces.   I can't figure it out.   Can someone tell me if there's something I'm missing on this?  When I tried to inset the code into the code snippet tool -- it broke up the text and I had to manually fix it.   Could this be at the heart of the problem somehow?</p>\n<pre><code>    package Launch;\n\nclass Fruit {\n    private String name;\n    private String color;\n    private String shape;\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public void setColor(String color) {\n        this.color = color;\n    }\n\n    public void setShape(String shape) {\n        this.shape = shape;\n    }\n}\n\n    \n\n\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        Fruit fruit1 = new Fruit();\n        fruit1.setName(&quot;Apple&quot;);\n        fruit1.setColor(&quot;Red&quot;);\n        fruit1.setShape(&quot;Oval&quot;);\n\n        System.out.println(fruit1.name + &quot; &quot; + fruit1.color + &quot; &quot; + fruit1.shape);\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n",

I got tunnel vision on the basics when looking to a more complicated subject.   From now on, I&#39;m going to try breaking the 2nd class off into a separate file to help keep the formatting straight in my mind - I think that&#39;ll help.

This didn&#39;t solve my issue (I actually needed to create a 2nd class named &#39;App&#39; that lived outside of the class fruit) but it got me thinking about the formatting errors I made.
