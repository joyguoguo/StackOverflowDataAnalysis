    "body" : "<p><strong>First, a little background:</strong></p>\n<p>I’m working on a proof of concept Java project that demonstrates how to develop, run and debug AWS Lambda functions locally using Localstack.</p>\n<p>This is the code for this project on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/josephmfaulkner/springboot-lambda-localstack/tree/live-reloading\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/josephmfaulkner/springboot-lambda-localstack/tree/live-reloading</a></p>\n<p>Right now, I’m focused on how to implement hot-reloading (live rebuild/reload) when running the application locally using Localstack. I’m using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) to define the app’s cloud infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Referencing Localstack’s documentation (<a href=\"https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/lambda-tools/hot-reloading/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/lambda-tools/hot-reloading/</a> ), the way to enable hot reloading for a Lambda function deployed on Localstack is to set the function’s CodeUri property to a non-existant S3 bucket called ‘hot-reload’ with a key set to the absolute path of the runtime artifacts directory. Like this:</p>\n<pre><code> SpringBootLambdaFunction:\n    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function\n    Properties:\n      FunctionName: SpringBootAPIHandler\n      Handler: com.javatechie.StreamLambdaHandler::handleRequest\n      Runtime: java21\n      CodeUri:\n        Bucket: hot-reload\n        Key: /home/user/appCode/build/SpringBootLambdaFunction\n</code></pre>\n<p>The ‘hot-reload’ bucket name tells localstack to use the contents of the host directory (specified with Key) as the functions handler and to watch for changes to this directory.</p>\n<p><strong>Now, here’s what I need help with</strong><br />\nI can prepare these artifacts for the Lambda function manually by extracting the artifacts in the packaged .zip archive into a directory but I need to figure out how to get Maven to do it for me when the project is built.\nI also want these artifacts created automatically when I make changes to the Lambda function’s source code (say, through a special Maven task like ./mvnw runWatchAndLiveReload).</p>\n<p>The artifacts need to be created with this structure:</p>\n<pre><code>artifactsFolder/\ncom/\nlib/\napplication.yml\n</code></pre>\n<p>What’s the best way for me to accomplish this?\nThank you for reading this, I’d appreciate the help.</p>\n",
