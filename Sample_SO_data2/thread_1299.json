SortOrder.java is generated twice..one under common folder and one under application folder</p>\n<p>Expected is\nOnly one class should be generated under Common folder</p>\n<p>What I tried but NO luck:\n1.Typemappings and importMappings\n2.even checked the order of generation.. first is common followed by application\n3.the $ref path is correct</p>\n<p>Anyway to resolve this duplicate class generation issue</p>\n",
