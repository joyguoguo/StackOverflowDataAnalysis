    "body" : "<p>System is on two site, facing issues on resiliency so using circuit breaker. When I am on close state then sending message to the primary site on call back on secondary site both are using different kafka pipeline. When on certain issue on primary site we close the pipeline and we switched to open state and sending message to secondary pipeline directly. Circuit breaker switched back to close state when primary kafka becomes healthy. In testing it switched to open state as expected but when our primary site restarted and we want to move back to close state then primary producer not able to connect to the pipeline and started throwing exception and our circuit breaker move back to open state.</p>\n<p>Issue - Producer is not able to send message on kafka pipeline restart.</p>\n<p>version</p>\n<p>Kafka-clients - 0.11.0.0</p>\n<p>Kafka-pipeline - 3.3.2</p>\n<p>using java 8</p>\n",
