    "title" : "How to launch Safari private browsing for Private Relay on Java Selenium?",
    "body" : "<p>I’m currently working on a Selenium project in Java that requires using Safari to take advantage of iCloud Private Relay’s IP shuffle functionality. After launching Safari from Selenium, I’m checking the IP address on <a href=\"https://whatismyipaddress.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://whatismyipaddress.com</a>. While I can confirm that Private Relay is active and my IP address is hidden, it doesn’t seem to shuffle or change as it does in Safari’s private browsing mode. Instead, it consistently uses the same Private Relay IP as the regular Safari window.</p>\n<p>Is there any workaround to enable IP shuffling or achieve similar functionality in this setup?</p>\n",
