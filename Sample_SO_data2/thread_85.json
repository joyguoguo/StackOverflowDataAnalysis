    "body" : "<p>I ran into the same problem with IntelliJ’s terminal. The default theme can make some text hard to read, especially the pale yellow on white.</p>\n<p>What worked for me was going to Settings → Tools → Terminal → Colors and adjusting the text color there. You can also tweak ANSI colors if certain outputs are still hard to see. Just make a copy of your current scheme first so you can revert if needed.</p>\n<p>After that, the terminal became much easier to read without changing the rest of the IDE theme.</p>\n",
