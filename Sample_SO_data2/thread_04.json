    "body" : "<p>I have a problem I am trying to implement a single signon on three frontend systems; user logins ;;;;;it creates it checks if he is in one two or three of the systems and then is taken to a dashboard to select what product he is in ; after selecting the product he is taken to an already existing frotend;   now the ommunications between different microservices was to be handled by microfrontend but we ran into issues between angular versions , the second option was to route the user per different url and now the problem was how do we take the data and access token from post authentication  and securely. One option was to attach it as params but it is too risy , the other was to use headers (not sure even if it can work) and the last option was to store in cookies from backend( I dont know how to). No we came up with a solution to use keycloak where a frontend registers to a keycloak and ones one person logs in the keycloak redirects you to a different url depending on the product and the role ( I am not sure if this is possible and if yes can it also be done in cognito): Honestly I want someone good in design practices to illustrayte each approach why it can and cant work ; what the trade offs and what is the best approach;  it is a very high security sensitive applicaions because it is associated with the bank</p>\n",

    "body" : "If all three frontends simultaneously insist they knew which system he belonged to, except each one uses a different idea of “already,” so the dashboard becomes a kind of suggestion rather than a destination. The microfrontends were supposed to coordinate everything but leaves the token wandering between URLs, headers, or cookies. Keycloak offers a path that may curve back on itself, while Cognito seems prepared to do something similar in a slightly different shape, depending on which role turns out to matter after the redirect that may not be a redirect at all.",
