However, there's one problem: if I run the Cleaner app, the service is killed and doesn't start again until I launch the app manually. Can you tell me how to prevent it from being killed or restart the service? My app is in Kivy + some service components are in Java.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v8UAACGo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v8UAACGo.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>I have found how to do it in settings (<strong>Settings-&gt;Applications-&gt;Autostart in background</strong>), but how create it in code when I install\\start my app.\nThe same telegram\\whatsapp are added here themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Автозапуск в фоновом режиме</strong> == <strong>Autostart in background</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ozWtXxA4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ozWtXxA4.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>Probably by rearchitecting your entire app.  Client server is not an effective architecture on Android.  Services do not last forever.  Even foreground services will eventually be killed on purpose by the OS.  Do not expect processes to continue on Android when not in the foreground.  It's against the entire design of the OS where it explicitly tries to prevent this behavior for battery life.  Instead, explain why you think you need that, and we may be able to tell you how to write your app to avoid needing it at all-  there are lots of ways to drive behavior on demand in Android rather than keeping a service around.</p>\n",

For you there is limited option. I&#39;ll suggest you to look into exclude it from battery optimization + adding a foreground service, which is a very common pattern for Android Watch app. Only the core difference will be, your app&#39;s user need to consciously put the app out of battery optimization. Also for specific cleaner app if possible add them to the list so they don&#39;t kill it. Hope that helps.",

      "body" : "@JessyJamesstandswithRussia You just cannot rely on a constantly running service of any sort on Android.  You need to find alternatives, such as using push messaging to notify the app that there is a call available.  Even if you could rely on it, it wouldn&#39;t work in Doze mode (the mode the phone enters when the screen is off for a while and almost all processing is killed to preserve battery life).",
