    "title" : "Calling Java from C using FFM",
    "body" : "<p>I've recently come across FFM as an alternative to JNI for Java-to-C communication.  However, I'm struggling with it.</p>\n<p>Calling C from Java seems straightforward (downcalling).  However, calling Java from C (upcalling) does not.  The only example I can find involves having the Java call the C passing a Java method.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if it is possible to have a C application call a Java method using FFM without the Java having passed something to the C application first, or is that only possible using JNI?</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Carl</p>\n",

If JNI is so risky, why does <code>java -verbose:jni -version</code> require Java itself to make about 100 JNI calls?  &quot;OH NOES!!! C CODE IS SKEEERY!!!&quot; is childish.

But I suppose there&#39;s a chance it may become <i>obsolete</i> for new projects in favor of FFM. That time is not now or even near, however, since JNI provides functionality that FFM doesn&#39;t and I know of no plans to change that. And yeah, Java has been moving towards strong encapsulation and &quot;integrity&quot; by default. Luckily, widely-used internal APIs like <code>Unsafe</code>--which projects used <i>at they&#39;re own risk</i>--are getting public, <i>supported</i> replacements. Seems like a good thing for long-term stability.",

Java will wind up as COBOL Jr. Or maybe the 2030&#39;s version of Pascal: an old language used to teach students who never use it again.
