    "body" : "<p>I am trying to make an app for android, just a small little &quot;Hello World&quot; app to assess how it all works. I have tried on numerous occasions to get gradle to wrap the app but I just keep running into error after error after failed attempt... This is more or less the procedure that I have used on 3+ occasions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>I install android studio, jdk 17, and gradle (default install ver. 4 had to remove and wget the .deb for v8)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>point JAVA_HOME:</p>\n<p>export JAVA_HOME=/PATH/TO/JAVA</p>\n<p>export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>make my basic app structure and starting code and verified with ai</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>thought gradle wrapper needed to run in project root, then learned that it needs to run in the main folder. ran gradle wrapper in .../app/src/main/</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>chmod +x gradlew</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>and then ./gradlew assembleDebug</p>\n<p>At this point, either only default tasks are available (or a short list with nothing helpful) or a longer list that does not include assembleDebug and even when I just try to do ./gradlew build, the build fails immediately. I removed any scrap of JDK or gradle from my system so if anyone can tell me maybe where i am going wrong here I would appreciate it</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",

Go to Android Studio-&gt; New -&gt; New Project-&gt; Empty Activity (for Jetpack Compose) or Empty Views Activity (for XML layout). It already comes with basic code for Hello World these days. Then you can prompt AI to make changes in your MainActivity although I'd highly recommend checking out tutorials and courses that are available to you. There are a ton in Youtube and developer.android.com also provides many tutorials.</p>\n",
