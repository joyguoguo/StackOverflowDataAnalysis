I want to detect when the user starts editing (i.e. when the inplace switches from the output state to the input state), for example to trigger a method or make an Ajax call.</p>\n<p>I have tried :</p>\n<p>Listening to focus or click using plain JS and a custom onstart handler</p>\n<p>Attaching JavaScript manually to the DOM node of the inplace label</p>\n<p>Exploring p:cellEditor, but it doesn’t work for my use case because I would like to use dynamics columns</p>\n<p>Is there a clean and supported way to detect when &lt;p:inplace&gt; enters its editable state (when the user clicks on it)?</p>\n<p>Could this be achieved with p:ajax, or do I need to manually extend the component in Java?</p>\n",
