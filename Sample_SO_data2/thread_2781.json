    "title" : "Running JavaFX Application on JRE 8u451 After JavaFX Removal",
    "body" : "<p>I'm facing an issue with a <strong>JavaFX</strong> application written for <strong>JDK 8</strong>. My company recently updated to <strong>JRE 8u451</strong>, and the application no longer runs because <strong>JavaFX</strong> has been removed from this release. I have access to the source code and can rebuild the project, but rewriting the application to use Swing or AWT, as Oracle suggests, is not an option. Additionally, upgrading to OpenJFX/OpenJDK (e.g., JavaFX 24 with Oracle JDK 24) is not feasible due to corporate restrictions: we cannot install third-party software, and executable files are limited to a whitelist.</p>\n<p>The error I get is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Error: JavaFX has been removed from JDK 8.\nVisit <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/javase/javafx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.oracle.com/javase/javafx</a> for more information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oracle recommends migrating to Swing or AWT, or taking advantage of the latest feature set available in JavaFX 24 (via the OpenJFX project at OpenJDK) on Oracle JDK 24. We have provided a guide on the OpenJFX wiki to assist developers familiar with JavaFX 8 who have not yet removed the dependency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oracle JDK 8u451, released on April 15, 2025, is the first Oracle JDK 8 release that does not include JavaFX.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here’s my Gradle project setup:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>plugins {\n    id 'java'\n}\n\ngroup = 'com.company.app'\nversion = '1.0.3'\n\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n\njava {\n    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    compileOnly 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.38'\n    annotationProcessor 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.38'\n    implementation 'org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.5'\n    implementation 'org.yaml:snakeyaml:2.4'\n    testImplementation platform('org.junit:junit-bom:5.10.0')\n    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter'\n    testAnnotationProcessor 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.38'\n    testCompileOnly 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.38'\n}\n\njar {\n    def jars = configurations.runtimeClasspath.files.collect { &quot;lib/$it.name&quot; }\n\n    destinationDirectory = layout.buildDirectory.dir('libs/app')\n\n    manifest {\n        attributes('Main-Class': 'com.company.app.App',\n                'Class-Path': jars.join(&quot; &quot;)\n        )\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Given these constraints, is there a way to restore the JavaFX functionality in my project? For example, can I include JavaFX libraries from an earlier JDK 8 release (e.g., 8u441) in my build, or is there another approach to make the application run on JRE 8u451 without violating corporate policies?</p>\n<p>Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n",
