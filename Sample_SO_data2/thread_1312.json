    "body" : "<p>I'm conducting a study in which I'm examining how effective LLMs are at translating code between frameworks. Here is one of the datasets I'm using to test this: <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-examples/tree/main/focused\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-examples/tree/main/focused</a></p>\n<p><code>focused</code> has many different &quot;examples&quot; inside of its repository (for instance, <code>faces/actionListener</code>). However, the pom.xml files in these examples all have references to their parent pom.xml files.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>actionListener</code> has this in its pom.xml:</p>\n<pre><code>\n    &lt;parent&gt;\n        &lt;groupId&gt;jakarta.examples.focused.faces&lt;/groupId&gt;\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;project&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;version&gt;10-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;/parent&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The authors of this dataset did this to take advantage of Maven inheritance, which makes sense.</p>\n<p>This isn't good, though, because I want every example to be able to run <em>completely</em> standalone. This is because I want to make a Docker container for each that anyone can run on their own machine. I'm doing this because I don't want to have access to the existing <code>.m2</code> cache on my local machine (e.g. for repository conflicts; also, just because I want anyone to be able to download and run these experiments).</p>\n<p>I have tried a few approaches, but none have truly worked;</p>\n<p><strong>mvn help:effective-pom</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This still leaves references to absolute paths on my computer (e.g. /Users/advait/Desktop) in certain parts of the effective pom, which obviously isn't suitable for an example that needs to run completely standalone in a Docker container. It also still leaves a reference to its parent module. Post-processing is required, and I don't know exactly what I need to keep/remove, which isn't ideal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Flatten pom plugin</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This just simply is not suitable for my needs, as it doesn't leave references to any of the Maven repositories required to build the project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A similar question has been asked here: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74330522/there-is-a-way-to-execute-just-a-maven-subproject\">There is a way to execute just a Maven subproject?</a>. However, this is a bad example repository, as all the examples in this repository are <em>truly</em> standalone. But, the question still stands, and I haven't found an answer.</p>\n<p>If I'm misunderstanding, or if there is another solution to my problem, please let me know!</p>\n",
