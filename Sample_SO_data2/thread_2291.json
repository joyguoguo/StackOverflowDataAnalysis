    "body" : "<p>I have a problem. Hibernate constraints have been created in a library developed by us and made known with the <code>resources/META-INF/validation.xml</code>. These validations work wonderfully. They are also entered in the entities via annotation. If I now create another constraint in my project and create a <code>validation.xml</code>, the one from the library is ignored. If I delete the <code>validation.xml</code> in my project again, the constraints from the library are executed, but not those from the project. Now I have searched for a solution and found these pages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68485941/how-to-register-custom-constraintmapping-for-validations-defined-in-validation-c\">How to register custom ConstraintMapping for validations defined in validation-constraints.xml</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61005154/hibernatevalidator-constraintmapping-for-the-fields-inside-nested-object-structu\">HibernateValidator constraintMapping for the fields inside nested object structure</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@cat.edelveis/creating-spring-boot-custom-validators-17790c33447e\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://medium.com/@cat.edelveis/creating-spring-boot-custom-validators-17790c33447e</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, they do not solve my problem. When I create a validator bean, the constrains are only executed with <code>xyzValidator.validate(...)</code>, but not with the <code>repo.save()</code> method, or with <code>@Valid parameter ...</code> in the REST service. What am I doing wrong? How can I register a custom constraint that is checked by Hibernate like all other constraints without being able to enter an annotation in the entity and without a <code>validation.xml</code>?</p>\n",
