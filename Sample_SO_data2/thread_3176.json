    "body" : "<p>My Eclipse's background turned black except for the code part. Everything works just fine but I just can't see the parts that turned black and it hurts my eyes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VNrfK4th.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What my eclipse looks like</a></p>\n<p>While I was trying to change my font sizes in Preferences&gt;General&gt;Appearance&gt;Colors and Fonts yesterday, I think I might have changed something that has nothing to do with the font sizes nor the text colors. So, something I touched might have turned the background black but when I changed font sizes yesterday, the background was fine. It somehow turned black today. So, I have no idea why it happened.</p>\n<p>I tried the &quot;Restore Defaults&quot; button and I even reinstalled Eclipse but it didn't work.</p>\n<p>Can someone please help this newbie fix this?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Thank you everyone for answering. My dumb dumb brain was kept looking at Appearance &gt; Colors and Fonts thinking that's where the Theme setting is. I found out where the Theme setting actually is and now it's fixed. Thank you for helping this newbie!</p>\n",
