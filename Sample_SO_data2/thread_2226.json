    "body" : "<p>I am experiencing an issue at my company's application where a docker container has memory that continues to grow until an OOM error occur and the container restarts. It seems to indicate there is a memory leak in the code for that container.</p>\n<p>It is a java application that is mainly sending/receiving/processing kafka events, we were able to reproduce this behaviour by simulating a large number of events. And it's using zookeeper to store some event data.</p>\n<p>Things I have tried:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>using jprofiler attached to the container. (jprofiler shows container memory is stable, no indication of memory leak, memory constantly being garbage collected.</li>\n<li>inspecting code for that container, nothing I have noticed that would cause a memory leak.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I wonder if someone who has experience in similar setup would advice me for the possible causes of the memory issue, and where/what I should be checking as my next step.</p>\n<p>Is it possible the memory issue is not related to the code but the docker system? I'm thinking of running that application as a standalone service and see if the same behaviour will be observed.</p>\n",

    "body" : "Check if the memory of the JVM is properly configured to fit inside the container&#39;s limits. Even if there is no leak, the simple fact of churning data will make the JVM&#39;s heap grows until the GC work is &quot;comfortable&quot;, possibly reaching the maximum of the heap memory. If that maximum is not properly configured (with -Xmx for example), it could be higher than what your container is allowed to have.
