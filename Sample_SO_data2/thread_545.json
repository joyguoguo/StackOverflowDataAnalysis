    "title" : "How to set invoice total for MUstangproject XRechnung",
    "body" : "<p>I want to generate an xml base invoice using the the Java lib from Mustangproject.\nI use the profile &quot;XRechnung&quot;. It works fine.\nBut there are rounding inconsitencies:\nThe mustanglib calculates VAT and sums itself.</p>\n<p>Now the problem is:\nWe have a price including VAT, for example 120€.\nWe calculate 7,85 as VAT.\nWhen we have a large quantity, for example 250, we get the problem:\nWe like to have exactly 7,85 * 250 as VAT, and exactly 120 * 250 as total sum.\nBut we get some cents more in the output:\nGrandTotal in xml is 30000.13 :-( and VAT is 1.962,62.</p>\n<p>It looks like it sums up the price without VAT, and then calculates the price with VAT again.</p>\n<p>So I tried to set the sum value it explicitly by using <code>CalculatedInvoice</code>. I tried:</p>\n<pre><code>void fillSums(CalculatedInvoice xInvoice, InputData invoiceData) {\n        xInvoice.calculate();\n        xInvoice.setLineTotalAmount(euroPriceOfCents(invoiceData.getInvoiceTotal()));\n        xInvoice.setGrandTotal(euroPriceOfCents(invoiceData.getInvoiceTotal()));\n        xInvoice.setTaxBasis(euroPriceOfCents(invoiceData.getInvoiceTaxValue()));\n        xInvoice.setDuePayable(euroPriceOfCents(invoiceData.getInvoiceTotal());\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>I see in the debugger the code is executed, but nevertheless the xml shows the wrong results.</p>\n",
