    "body" : "<p>I am using Talend 6.4, and for auditing and traceability purposes,We want to ensure that the JAR files deployed to production are authentic and unchanged from the original source jobs. While Talend allows versioning in job names, this alone is not a reliable guarantee of integrity. It’s possible for two jobs to have the same version number in their .item and .properties files but contain different logic or configurations.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Solution</strong>\nTo address this, we think it is better to :\nEmbed the job’s .item and .properties files inside the JAR, specifically under the META-INF directory.\nDuring the CI/CD pipeline, compare the embedded .item and .properties files in the JAR with the current workspace versions to verify integrity.\nIf there’s a mismatch, the pipeline should fail or raise a warning.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge</strong>\nCurrently, we are unable to find a straightforward way to configure this behavior using Talend 6.4. We suspect that the solution lies in customizing the Maven build process via the Project Settings under:\nProject Parameters → Maven\nProject POM Settings\nMaven POM Settings\nMaven Assembly Settings\nHowever, it’s unclear:\nWhich of these settings should be modified.\nWhat exact configuration should be added to include the .item and .properties files in the META-INF directory of the JAR.</p>\n<p>Does any one have any guidance or other ideas?</p>\n",
