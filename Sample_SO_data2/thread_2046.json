    "body" : "<p>I'm encountering an issue with Spring Boot Validation. I'm currently using Spring Boot version 2.4.4 and <code>hibernate-validator</code> version <code>5.1.0.Final</code>. When validating with <code>javax.validation.constraints.NotBlank</code>, the validation always &quot;succeeds&quot;, even when the value is null or an empty string.</p>\n<p>After some investigation, I found that the problem arises because the version of Hibernate I’m using matches the annotation <code>org.hibernate.validator.constraints.NotBlank</code>, which causes my <code>javax</code> annotations to be ignored. I attempted to create a custom <code>JavaxNotBlankValidation</code> and inject it into the container, but it didn’t work as expected.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to define a <code>Validation</code> for the existing <code>javax</code> annotation <code>without creating a new one (e.g., my.custom.annotation.NotBlank)</code> and still have it function properly?</p>\n<p>PS: During my investigation, I realized that the version of <code>hibernate-validator</code> is outdated. When I upgraded to version <code>6.1.0.Final</code>, this issue was resolved. However, due to various resasons, my request to update the dependency version was declined, so I must continue working with the current version.</p>\n",

    "body" : "If you are on Spring Boot 2.4.4 <b>and</b> are using <code>hibernate-validator</code> version 5.1.0 you already have a dependency mess and meaning that you are manually managing dependencies. Spring Boot 2.4.4 uses (and is tested with) hibernate validator 6.1.7. So I wouldn&#39;t request an upgrade I would simply ditch the dependency and instead include <code>spring-boot-starter-validation</code> as you should have done in the first place. Which makes me worried about your whole project and the other dependencies in there as well.",
