    "title" : "NetBeans code templates - template for assigning variable name based on right side",
    "body" : "<p>I would like to write a code template that automatically assigns a default name to a variable based on the right side of the assignment. Example: Take the following template:</p>\n<pre><code>${TYPE rightSideType default=&quot;java.util.Iterator&quot; editable=false} ${Iterator newVarName default=&quot;it&quot;}=${ITERABLE instanceof=&quot;java.util.Iterable&quot; default=&quot;itrbl&quot;}.iterator();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now assume the following code I'm working on:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; myWonderfulList=new LinkedList();\n\ntpl&lt;Tab&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>&quot;tpl&lt;Tab&gt;&quot; means that I'm invoking the code template I just mentioned.</p>\n<p>NetBeans will put the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; myWonderfulList=new LinkedList();     // this was already there\n\nIterator&lt;String&gt; iterator=myWonderfulList.iterator();      // this is the line NetBeans will generate\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is all wonderfully correct, except that I don't like the suggested name: &quot;iterator&quot;. I would like &quot;myWonderfulListIterator&quot; as the default suggestion, constructed as [variable name on the right hand side]+&quot;Iterator&quot;. So, basically I want NetBeans to suggest this:</p>\n<pre><code>Iterator&lt;String&gt; myWonderfulListIterator=myWonderfulList.iterator();\n</code></pre>\n<p>(&quot;myWonderfulListIterator&quot; can then be initially selected with the cursor for immediately typing something else if wanted, just as normal.)</p>\n<p>I checked the source code in org.netbeans.modules.editor.java.JavaCodeTemplateProcessor and couldn't find anything promising, but the code is a little hard to read with respect to all its details. Am I missing anything? Is there any way to achieve what I have in mind? It feels so normal and natural to me (almost like it should be the default everywhere when using code templates) that I can't imagine they forgot this when coding the code template system, but I can't find out how to do it.</p>\n<p>There's a similar provision with the &quot;fore&quot; code template, where the name of the Iterable variable on the right hand side prescribes the initial suggestion for the element variable on the left side, but so far I've been unable to learn from that template how to achieve my goal. Can anyone help, please?</p>\n",
