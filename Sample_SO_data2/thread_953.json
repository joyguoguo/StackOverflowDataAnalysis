    "body" : "<p>In the Maven repository, there are two dependencies available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat-jdbc/11.0.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tomcat-jdbc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.tomcat/jdbc-pool/1.1.0.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tomcat-jdbc-pool</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I understand that <strong><code>tomcat-jdbc-pool</code></strong> is the dependency used in Tomcat for connection pooling, as stated in the documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Commons DBCP is over 60 classes. tomcat-jdbc-pool core is 8 classes, hence modifications for future requirements will require much fewer changes. This is all you need to run the connection pool itself, the rest is gravy.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also see that <strong>tomcat-dbcp</strong> is an older alternative built on <strong>Apache Commons DBCP</strong>, which was replaced with <strong>tomcat-jdbc-pool</strong>.</p>\n<p>So, exactly where does the <strong><code>tomcat-jdbc</code></strong> Maven dependency fit in?</p>\n",

That makes it likely that this is for a very old and no longer supported version of Tomcat. By contrast, Tomcat JDBC is actively maintained and can be found in the Maven Central repository. I assume you can safely ignore the <code>tomcat-jdbc-pool</code> artifact.",
