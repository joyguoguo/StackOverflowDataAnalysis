    "body" : "<p>I am writing a library which uses openapi-generator generated models and I don't want to expose these models to the consumers of my library.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to make my models package-private and compile them to the same package as my integration code? There probably is a better way of doing this using modules but that's not really an option for me.</p>\n<p>I have seen examples online with Mustache templates for altering the generated code but that does not seem like a good solution. Do I need to keep my own version of all of the generator template files just to change one keyword? Or is there a better way of doing this?</p>\n",
