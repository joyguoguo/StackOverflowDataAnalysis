    "body" : "<p>When I downloaded the java 3d api library from the oracle site version 1.5.1 and placed it correctly in the files of the <strong>bluej</strong> program version 4.1.2, this error message appears to me when running the code:\njava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: E:\\BlueJ-windows-412\\bluej\\jdk\\jre\\bin\\j3dcore-ogl.dll: Can't load AMD 64-bit .dll on a IA 32-bit platform</p>\n<p>and some times I show this error message when I compile the code:\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class com.sun.j3d.utils.universe.SimpleUniverse</p>\n<p>I expected the libraries to work as soon as I added them and not show me any error messages, but that didn't happen, even though my version of Java 3D is exactly the same as those I've seen in videos on YouTube.\nI also added the libraries to the lib files in BlueJ and saw that the libraries were indeed read, and the programming commands are no longer strange in the program, but the error message still appears to me.\nAfter asking many sites, I found out that there is a possibility that the Java version of the library is for 64-bit and the Java version of BlueJ is 32-bit, I think, but I am not sure about this information, and I would like to have confirmation of it along with an answer to my question.</p>\n",
