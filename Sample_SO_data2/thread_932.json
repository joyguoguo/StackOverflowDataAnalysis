    "body" : "<p>I work at an organization that has several Java Spring backend services (for example, <code>CRUD_service</code>) as well as one common library, <code>common</code> which all of the services depend on. When debugging in the <code>CRUD_service</code> repo, I often need to set breakpoints on lines that are part of <code>common</code>. Since <code>common</code> is a different project, IntelliJ has to decompile <code>common</code> files as .class files, which changes the formatting of the code compared to the source, and occasionally leads to &quot;byte code and source code out of sync&quot; issues.</p>\n<p>I discovered that in IntelliJ, you can go to <strong>File -&gt; Project Structure -&gt; Modules</strong>, then import <code>common</code> as a module, and add it as a module dependency of <code>CRUD_service</code>. However, I ALSO want to be able to use the code from the .jar file referenced in my pom.xml (in order to access specific versions of <code>common</code> that are stored locally). Ideally I would have two separate configs or profiles, one which points to the source code, and one which uses the compiled code, and be able to easily switch back and forth between these different profiles. Is there any way to do this, either through IntelliJ or Maven? I've seen similar questions to this one, but nothing regarding switching back and forth dynamically between the two. Thanks!</p>\n",
