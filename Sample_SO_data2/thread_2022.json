    "body" : "<p>I've been trying to implement a password reset feature in my Spring Boot + Thymeleaf app, but it's been giving me a relatively hard time. I used to have a page where users could enter their email, and that part seemed to work - at least on the surface. But after submitting the email, I either got a completely white screen or, after some changes, a 404/500 when trying to access the reset link with the token.</p>\n<p>I’ve checked that the controller for /reset-password exists and that the template seems to be not misplaced. I also made sure the form submits to the correct route. Still, somehow something's off and I can't figure out why the redirect or rendering fails after the email/click on reset password step.</p>\n<p>I believe I’ve tried most of the usual things - adjusting the routes, testing with and without a token, simplifying the logic, looking for duplicates in Controllers etc. but nothing seems to fix it.</p>\n<p>I’ve uploaded a stripped down version of the project (hopefully without anything too sensitive) here:\n<a href=\"https://git.informatik.uni-rostock.de/kk2316/scrum_reset_bug\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">scrum_reset_bug Gitlab repo</a></p>\n<p>Would really appreciate if someone could take a look.</p>\n<p>I tried submitting the email to trigger the reset flow. I expected to either get a confirmation message or be redirected to a reset form. Instead, I got either a white screen, or after some changes, a 404/500 error when clicking the reset link with the token.</p>\n",
