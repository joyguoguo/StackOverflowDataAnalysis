    "body" : "<p>My VoIP Android app shows a full-screen incoming call UI using Android’s full-screen intent (FSI).\nOn Samsung Android 16, the FSI works perfectly when installing the debug build — but fails completely in the release build (Play Store). I need help understanding the difference and why Samsung blocks it.</p>\n<p>Xiaomi: FSI works only after enabling “Show on Lock Screen” under “Other Permissions”. So OEM-specific suppressions exist.</p>\n<p>Samsung Android 16: No similar toggle available</p>\n<p>Permissions / settings (all granted by user)</p>\n<p>I am using an old build toolchain, and I cannot upgrade. Android Gradle Plugin, AGP version: 8.2.2, target: 34</p>\n<p>Push arrives via Batch.com (not Firebase-only).\nRelease and debug receive the push.\nOnly release fails to launch the full-screen Activity.</p>\n<p>Please analyze why the exact same code executes FSI on Samsung Android 16 in debug mode, but not in release mode, and provide:</p>\n<p>Samsung-specific rules that suppress full-screen intents (FSI).</p>\n<p>How Samsung differentiates “debug” and “release” apps at the OS level.</p>\n<p>Whether Samsung blocks FSI for non-dialer apps or non-privileged packages unless:</p>\n<p>App is default Dialer</p>\n<p>App has specific roles</p>\n<p>App meets call-style UI expectations</p>\n<p>Whether signature, Play Store install source, or app reputation affects FSI.</p>\n<p>Whether Samsung requires the CALL notification channel to be created ONLY once, or with specific flags.</p>\n<p>How to get equivalent to Xiaomi “Other permissions → Show on Lock screen” on Samsung.</p>\n<p>Any Samsung OneUI 6 / Android 16 behavior that silently downgrades CALL notifications to heads-up notifications for release apps.</p>\n<p>Any known OEM bugs where debug apps bypass FSI restrictions but release apps don’t.</p>\n<p>How to reliably force FSI to appear on Samsung for normal VoIP apps.</p>\n",
