    "body" : "Instead of using plain strings as endpoint configuration I&#39;d suggest to use <a href=\"https://camel.apache.org/manual/Endpoint-dsl.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EndpoinRouteBuilder and its DSL</a> to reduce the chance of typing errors and invalid arguments. Instead of <code>.to(&quot;log:...&quot;)</code> you can also write <code>.log(...)</code> which makes the route definition easier to read. Camel will also only resolve &quot;{{property}}&quot; properties from either system, env or application properties by default AFAIK. You could try to use &quot;simple&quot; like that <code>.log(&quot;thisIs${properties:broken}completely&quot;)</code> to let simple try and resolve that property for you",
