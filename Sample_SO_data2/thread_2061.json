    "body" : "<p>I am using java based application to publish &amp; consume <code>RabbitMq</code> services for message exchanges.\nSo architecture is pretty simple\nJava application which produces &amp; consume messages from RMQ nothing too much complex.\nCase or rather problem statement is I am publishing messages to RMQ in a huge load lets say 10 messages per second. with sample below format in <code>JSON</code> data</p>\n<pre><code>{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;a:1143-fdf45-34fd4-23d23f&quot;, &quot;class&quot;:&quot;AClass&quot;}\n{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;a:2243-fdf45-34fd4-23d23f&quot;, &quot;class&quot;:&quot;BClass&quot;}\n{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;a:3343-fdf45-34fd4-23d23f&quot;, &quot;class&quot;:&quot;AClass&quot;}\n{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;a:4443-fdf45-34fd4-23d23f&quot;, &quot;class&quot;:&quot;CClass&quot;}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and for some reason the messages took considerable longer time to process, and by that time next messages are already published.\nin this case, I am wanted to reshuffle or reorder the messages which are placed in RMQ or already published to RMQ (<strong>group by</strong> <code>id</code>, <code>class</code>).\ndoes <code>RMQ</code> allows me to inject such type of stratergy ?\nIf not then is there work around to reorder before publishing the messages to RMQ ?\nsince in my Microservice, controller receive the POST request for single object and it will do <code>channel.basicPublish</code> as of now this is straight forward flow. main objective is to not to de-duplicate, but rather arrange them in a custom sequence.</p>\n",

    "body" : "If you have a fixed number of possible classes (let&#39;s say a total of 100 possible classes), you can setup priority of each. Afterwards, whenever data is pushed to the queue, it will be stored automatically grouped by priority and will be fetched by clients in the order of priority. So if someone pushes 3 elements in order [<code>AClass</code>, <code>BClass</code>, <code>AClass</code>], clients will first fetch 2x <code>AClass</code> and afterwards the <code>BClass</code> (assuming AClass has higher priority). So grouping by class (or any attribute for which you know possible options when configuring rabbit queue) is sort of possible.",
