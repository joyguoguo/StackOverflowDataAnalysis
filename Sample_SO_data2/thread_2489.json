    "body" : "The line <code>.method public static $default$test(Lmy&#47;TestListener;ZI)V</code> tells that there is a <i>static</i> method named <code>$default$test</code> inside the class <code>my.TestListener$-CC</code>, <i>not the interface</i>. That method may be result of transforming code from using default methods in an interface to not using default methods, however, if that’s the case, it’s obviously incomplete. There’s clearly an <i>abstract</i> method in the interface, so the implementation class needs a non-abstract counterpart which may invoke that static method if that’s the intended strategy, but this non-abstract method is missing.",
