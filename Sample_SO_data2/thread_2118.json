    "title" : "Unable to create new folder inside src/main/java in IntelliJ IDEA when folder is marked as Sources Root",
    "body" : "<p>I’m working on a Java Spring Boot project in IntelliJ IDEA. My folder structure is like this:\nsrc/main/java/com/discordbot/sentry</p>\n<p>The problem is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The src/main/java folder is marked as Sources Root (blue folder).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Inside IntelliJ, the nested packages sometimes show as a single folder with dots (like com.discordbot.sentry).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I can’t create new directories inside src/main/java or inside these package folders unless I unmark the folder as Sources Root.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I want to add new regular folders (not Java packages) inside the source folder for resources or bot modules.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What am I missing? How can I create normal folders inside a Sources Root in IntelliJ IDEA without breaking the project structure?</p>\n<p>Please bear with me as I’m still learning. I’m hoping someone can clarify the reasoning behind this behavior or suggest a better workflow.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n<p>I have read the official JetBrains article explaining how to create regular directories inside a Java project in IntelliJ IDEA:\n<a href=\"https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/articles/SUPPORT-A-345/How-to-create-a-regular-directory-not-a-package-in-a-Java-project-in-IntelliJ-IDEA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/articles/SUPPORT-A-345/How-to-create-a-regular-directory-not-a-package-in-a-Java-project-in-IntelliJ-IDEA</a></p>\n<p>The explanation is pretty clear and easy to understand. I followed the instructions about unmarking the folder as a Sources Root to create regular directories.</p>\n<p>However, what I don’t understand is why IntelliJ enforces these restrictions at all — why can’t I create normal folders inside a Sources Root without unmarking it?</p>\n<p>I’m hoping someone can clarify the reasoning behind this behavior or suggest a better workflow.</p>\n",

    "body" : "<h2><strong>Why folders are changing into packages?</strong></h2>\n<p>Java packages are folders actually. If you mark a directory of folder as sources root then folders inside (subdirectories) will be treated as packages until you explicitly mark them as excluded or resource in IntelliJ-IDEA.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to create directory for resources?</strong></h2>\n<p>You can mark any directory under Java project as resources and put resource files like images, audios or any non-code files inside them</p>\n<p><strong>File &gt;&gt; Project Structure  &gt;&gt; Modules &gt;&gt; Sources (Select any directory and mark it as resources or anything else you want)</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>What is good practice?</strong></h2>\n<p>It is possible to mark any directory as resources folder or put resource files in any Java package but this generally isn't encouraged. You should follow project/directory structure conventions. Usually resources folder is separated from the code. I have added link to some blogs, give them a read and understand project structure conventions.</p>\n<p><strong>Also note that there is no such thing as bot modules in Java.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Helpful blogs:</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/maven-directory-structure\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maven standard directory structure</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://howtodoinjava.com/java/io/read-file-from-resources-folder/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Read File from resources folder</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jenkov.com/tutorials/maven/directory-structure.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maven directory structure</a></p>\n",

In Java, folders inside <code>src/main/java</code> are tied to package names, so IntelliJ expects you to create them as <strong>packages</strong>, not raw directories.</p>\n<p>The fix:<br />\n<strong>Right-click → New → Package</strong> instead of New → Directory.<br />\nThat way, IntelliJ links the folder to the correct package structure.</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who helped clarify this!</p>\n",

    "body" : "&quot;<i>Inside IntelliJ, the nested packages sometimes show as a single folder with dots</i>&quot; – This is a feature, not a bug. It&#39;s also only a visual thing. The <code>com&#47;discordbot&#47;sentry</code> directory structure is how the <code>com.discordbot.sentry</code> package is represented on the file system, and so the IDE <i>displays</i> it as a package, but it remains nested folders behind the scenes. Also, Java projects typically separate sources and resources. A &quot;sources root&quot; is explicitly and specifically for <i>source files</i>. Other resources go in the &quot;resources root&quot; (e.g., <code>src&#47;main&#47;resources</code> in Maven/Gradle based projects).",
