    "title" : "Is Thymeleaf still maintained, and is there a Thymeleaf version compatible with Spring Boot 4 / Spring Framework 7?",
    "body" : "<p>Spring Boot <strong>4.0</strong> and Spring Framework <strong>7.0</strong> were recently released, and I’m considering upgrading my project.\nHowever, my application uses Thymeleaf, specifically the thymeleaf-spring6 integration module, which is tied to the corresponding Spring Framework major version.</p>\n<p>When checking the Thymeleaf GitHub repository, development activity for the Spring integration modules (e.g., thymeleaf-spring6) appears to be minimal in recent months/years. This raises a few questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is Thymeleaf still actively maintained?</li>\n<li>Will there be a Thymeleaf-Spring7 integration module for Spring Framework 7 / Spring Boot 4?</li>\n<li>Or is Thymeleaf effectively discontinued, meaning I should consider an alternative server-side template engine for the upgrade?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any official information or guidance from the Thymeleaf maintainers or the community would be appreciated.</p>\n",

I think, assumption on my part based on how this question is formulated and the end conclusion for most Maven + Spring Boot questions, the main issue here is that you were linking directly to Spring dependencies in your pom rather than using the starter. You shouldn't really be aware that there is a thymeleaf-spring6 dependency, dependencies and their versions are managed by the Spring Boot team(s) through the starter dependencies. If you start to circumvent the starters, you run into issues of mismatched dependencies.</p>\n",
