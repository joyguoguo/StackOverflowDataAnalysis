    "body" : "<p>In Spring WebFlux, when working with reactive streams , why is it recommended to return a <code>Publisher</code> (like <code>Mono.error()</code>) instead of throwing an exception directly within a stream?</p>\n<p>I saw <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69178870/throwing-an-exception-vs-mono-error-in-spring-webflux\">this</a> question and the example mentioned in the response but I would like a clear explanation that provides a general understanding of the real problems with throwing exceptions in reactive streams, not just an example.</p>\n",
