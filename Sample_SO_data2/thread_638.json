    "body" : "<p>Have a good one, fellow programmers õ/</p>\n<p>I''d like to apologize beforehand for not being clear enough/broken english/stupid question.</p>\n<p>At my workplace there are a couple of projects (java 8 + angular) that in order to test my changes i've been instructed to create a new .war file containing both the front-end and the back-end. I also have to stop and restart the server (WildFly) and login again in the login API used there. This process takes up to 4 minutes. 4 minutes to test a single changed comma label \uD83E\uDEE0. As you can imagine this is very frustrating and tiresome.</p>\n<p>I've tried running the back and front-end separately asking ChatGPT but i had to make a lot of changes in my workspace and in the end i reached a brick wall in the login API. I might provide a bit more info if needed such as the errors i'm getting, but i would like to know if this is a simple task i'm dealing with or maybe i should just give up because it would not be possible...</p>\n",
