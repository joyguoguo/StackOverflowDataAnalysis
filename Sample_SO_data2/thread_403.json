    "title" : "Javalin dependency does not load from Maven repo due to CVE",
    "body" : "<p>I'm trying to use Javalin in a new project I'm working on but every version of Javain has a dependency containing a CVE, and thus, none of the Javalin JAR versions can be downloaded from mvnrepository.</p>\n<p>The problem appears to be centered around the <em>webdrivermanager</em> dependency.  Here is the vulnerability stated on mvnrepository:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This vulnerability is associated with program files\nsrc/main/java/io/github/bonigarcia/wdm/WebDriverManager.java. This\nissue affects webdrivermanager: from 1.0.0 before 6.0.2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Looking at the latest version of Javain, its POM shows it is using a version more recent than 6.0.2</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lt;webdrivermanager.version&gt;6.3.2&lt;/webdrivermanager.version&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, like the error message above states, the CVE seems to have been fixed as of version 6.0.2 in WebDriverManager.  So, why is this JAR shown as vulnerable/undownloadable?  And, how do I fix it?</p>\n",
