From what I've seen, my first attempt should've been enough.</p>\n<p>I had originally tried to do this on Replit, but had to move to VSCode since my program got too big. It originally printed a red heart with no issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n<p>My question got closed as a duplicate, so I checked the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18856056/why-some-unicode-characters-appears-to-be-question-mark-in-the-console\">post that was linked</a> to see if I could get any new info, and I also tried something another user commented (Thank you, DuncG!)\nThe solution in the other post was that the were not using UTF-8, I know with 100% certainty, however, that I am.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DdUK38u4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DdUK38u4.png\" alt=\"The bottom right corner of my VSCode window which shows that I am using UTF-8.\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1NSl5z3L.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1NSl5z3L.png\" alt=\"My Files.Encoding setting, which shows again that I'm using UTF-8\" /></a></p>\n<p>Just as an extra precaution, however, I tried what DuncG suggested, which was to go into chcp 65001 mode and paste a heart into the terminal.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2fi94TOM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2fi94TOM.png\" alt=\"On the first line, chcp 65001 mode is turned on.

On the last, I re-tried running my program, and the output was gibberish instead of a red heart.\" /></a></p>\n<p>I've also tried changing the font to Segoe UI Emoji, since that is Windows' Emoji Font. This, however, was also unsuccessful:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pBmisalf.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pBmisalf.png\" alt=\"On the first line, chcp 65001 mode is turned on.
