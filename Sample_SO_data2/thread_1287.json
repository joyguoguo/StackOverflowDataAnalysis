    "body" : "<p>I want to upgrade Flutter from 3.19.2 to 3.22 and run the resulting code on an Android project, but I encountered an error:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>[ERROR:flutter/shell/platform/android/platform_view_android_jni_impl.cc(1163)] \nCould not locate SurfaceTextureWrapper.shouldUpdate method\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now I know what caused it: After Flutter 3.22, the Flutter embedding implementation for PlatformView has added a new JNI interface, <code>SurfaceTextureWrapper.shouldUpdate</code>, to support more precise texture control. If certain third-party libraries or plugins implement a custom PlatformView, or engage in interactions related to SurfaceTexture on the Android side, they may need to implement or support this new method. But many packages do not do that.</p>\n<p>New implementation interface in flutterEmbedded layer Code submission record:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/49653\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/49653</a></p>\n<p>I need some suggestions.</p>\n",
