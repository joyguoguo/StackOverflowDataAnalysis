    "title" : "Unable to locate an element with the xpath expression //span[@class=&#39;windowTitle&#39;]",
    "body" : "<p>OK I cannot figure out this error.  We are running an IE test (testng with selenium) (which opens Edge) on a Jenkins machine.  I keep getting this error &quot;Unable to locate an element with the xpath expression //span[@class='windowTitle']&quot; (see HTML below).  The Jenkins logfile has the source HMTL and when I inspect and do a search for &quot;//span[@class='windowTitle']&quot; it finds it fine.  When we get a Jenkins error I always download to Eclipse and run locally on my machine.  When I do that it finds the xpath with no problems.  Xpaths prior to this statement are also found.</p>\n<p>Usually with &quot;Object Errors&quot; it can be a driver/browser mismatch.  I don't have direct access to the Jenkins machine but they told me it is Edge Version 142.0.3595.53 and we just updated (to try to fis the problem which didn't work) the driver to 142.0.3595.80.</p>\n<p>HTML code is (partial)</p>\n<pre><code> &lt;span class=&quot;windowNoMargin&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;span class=&quot;windowTitle&quot;&gt;Search Facility&lt;/span&gt;\n   &lt;span class = 'buttonarea'&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;\n &lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>As I say those object errors are usually a result of mismatched browser/driver but these should be compatible.</p>\n<p>The code searching for the XPATH:</p>\n<pre><code>do {\n    System.out.println(&quot;Searching for Search Input Page Header&quot;);\n} while (!timer.done() &amp;&amp; !SeleniumTools.waitForWebElementVisible(driver, By.xpath(gei.getProperty(\n                &quot;searchPage_Title&quot;)), DELAY));\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>waitForWebElementVisible()</code> does a <code>WebDriverWait</code> for the expected condition.  The property &quot;searchPage_Title&quot; is  <code>searchPage_Title=//span[@class='windowTitle']</code></p>\n<p>I am not sure what else to try.  Again to reiterate it works find when I run it locally from my machine.  My Edge is 142.0.3595.80 and Edge Driver is 142.0.3595.76.  I don't believe the IEDriverServer has changed in a long time.  I did a query for the latest version 4.14.0.0.</p>\n<p>I would like to include more HTML code but am worried about company proprietary information.</p>\n",
