    "title" : "CXF Custom Class name",
    "body" : "<p>I need to migrate from Axis2 to CXF and I need some classes to have custom names. They are defined as elements in their xsd with underscores, think my_Enum_Name. CXF makes MYENUMNAME out of those and I need it to be MY_ENUM_NAME. I tried this in the bindings file:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;jxb:bindings node=&quot;xs:simpleType[@name='my_Enum_Name']&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;jxb:typesafeEnumClass name=&quot;MY_ENUM_NAME&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;jxb:typesafeEnumMember name=&quot;EMPTY&quot; value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;/jxb:typesafeEnumClass&gt;\n    &lt;/jxb:bindings&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>But the generated file still has the name MYENUMNAME. Any ideas?</p>\n",
