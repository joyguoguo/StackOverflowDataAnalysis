    "body" : "<p>I'm running a GitLab CI pipeline with 30+ tests in parallel, each taking 5-10 minutes. I've configured Gradle to use build cache, which works great when tests need to run.</p>\n<p>However, even when a test is cached, the GitLab runner still takes ~4 minutes to start up and determine the cache status. This seems inefficient as we're spinning up runners just to find out we don't need them.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to query Gradle's build cache status for a task without actually executing the task or its setup? The --dry-run option doesn't show cache status information.</p>\n<p>I'm looking for something like:</p>\n<p><code>gradle someCommand --check-cache-only myTest</code></p>\n<p>This would help optimize our CI pipeline by avoiding unnecessary runner startups.</p>\n",

    "body" : "Unfortunately, Gradle doesn’t offer a built‐in way to just “check” the cache for a task without going through the task’s execution lifecycle. The cache lookup is integrated into the task’s execution phase, which is why even a cached task still goes through some of the startup and setup work.",
