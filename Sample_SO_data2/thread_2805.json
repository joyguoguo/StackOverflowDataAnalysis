    "body" : "<p>So I have a bunch of these errors in the title when I try to put my generated openapi.json in the Swagger Editor. Since I don't want to write any description where the description is required and there are a LOT of them, I figured I could automate this by grabbing all the missing descriptions and add a &quot;&quot; or &quot; &quot; to make the errors go away.</p>\n<p>Although when I manually type description = &quot;&quot; in the editor where it points me, when I put the same thing in my java code the description = &quot;&quot; doesn't appear at all in the resulting json.</p>\n<p>The way I tried to solve this is by implementing <code>ContainerReponseFilter</code> registrating it on my <code>ResourceConfig</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>public class SwaggerBlankDescriptionFilter implements ContainerResponseFilter {\n@Override\npublic void filter(ContainerRequestContext request, COntainerResponseContext response)\nthrows IOException {\nif (response.getEntity() instanceof Operation operation){\n        for(ApiResponse apiResponse: operation.getResponses().values()){\n            if(apiResponse.getDescription().isEmpty()){\n                apiResponse.setDescription(&quot;&quot;)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>Why I'm trying like this is because the missing descriptions should be located at <code>@Operation(... responses = @ApiResponse())</code> in the @ApiResponse</p>\n<p>Even if I try to catch a specific value in my filter method rather than a Empty I'm still unable to alter the description field.</p>\n<p>How can I make this work?</p>\n",
