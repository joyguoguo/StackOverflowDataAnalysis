    "title" : "What may hold back from running the simplest Java code in Intellij?",
    "body" : "<p>I wanted to take (almost the first) steps towards Java and IntelliJ Idea, installed JDK (21.0.7 community editon) and IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 (Community Edition) on my Ubuntu. Started the IntelliJ and discovered there is tutorial IdeaLearningProject and took it for introduction. Step 6 in this tutorial is <strong>running the current file</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WxD1IOvw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WxD1IOvw.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>As you may see from the screenshot:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the run-button is inactive</li>\n<li>the tooltip says &quot;The file in the editor is not runnable&quot;</li>\n<li>neither does help the shortcut.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After googleing the &quot;not runnable&quot;-tip and trying different solutions (which did not help, but closely furter below) I thought to create first sample project with simplest code to test, does this run?</p>\n<p>So I created New -&gt; Project and ticked the option &quot;add sample code&quot;. Without changing anything I clicked the run-button which:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>deactiveted the buttton (as in tutorial)</li>\n<li>outed some error:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Error running 'Main'\ncom.android.tools.idea.gradle.dcl.lang.DeclarativeParserDefinition\nPluginClassLoader(plugin=PluginDescriptor(name=Gradle Declarative\nSupport, id=com.android.tools.gradle.dcl, descriptorPath=plugin.xml,\npath=~/bin/intellij/plugins/android-gradle-declarative-lang-ide,\nversion=251.23774.435, package=null, isBundled=true),\npackagePrefix=null, state=active,\nparents=PluginDescriptor(name=Kotlin, id=org.jetbrains.kotlin,\ndescriptorPath=plugin.xml, path=~/bin/intellij/plugins/Kotlin,\nversion=251.23774.435-IJ, package=org.jetbrains.kotlin,\nisBundled=true), PluginDescriptor(name=Gradle, id=com.intellij.gradle,\ndescriptorPath=plugin.xml, path=~/bin/intellij/plugins/gradle,\nversion=251.23774.435, package=null, isBundled=true),\nPluginDescriptor(name=Java, id=com.intellij.java,\ndescriptorPath=plugin.xml, path=~/bin/intellij/plugins/java,\nversion=251.23774.435, package=null, isBundled=true), )</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This error does not make any sense to me.</p>\n<p>So what have I tried? After googleing some suggestions were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>mark directory as &quot;Sources Root&quot;. tried, it was already. unmarked and marked again. nothing changed</li>\n<li>restore IDE default settings. Did, restarted, nothing changed.</li>\n<li>&quot;It looks like you have not added a run configuration&quot;-answer in SO <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/78779175/196241\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/78779175/196241</a> notices &quot; I tried to add some, but I have no clue, what this conf should contain. I tried some examples provided there, but nothing worked. So I created project with sample code, but this did not include also any run configuration. Should it?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The sample Main class looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.printf(&quot;Hello and welcome!&quot;);\n\n        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++) {\n            System.out.println(&quot;i = &quot; + i);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If I try to run it, it directs me to edit configuration, from the selection the &quot;Applications&quot; seems the only viable of options, but after choosing it and running I get warning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Configuration is still incorrect. Do you want to edit it again?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I opt to continue, I get error:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Error running 'Unnamed'\nNo main class defined</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My problem seems to be bind to some kind of configuration file (for build system?), but why is this missing? How should I know what is missing, already in tutorial-phase?</p>\n<p>I'd like to find the answer in IntelliJ-context, swapping to other IDE is next path, if needed. As you already assumed, yes, I am totally stranger to Java ecosystem.</p>\n",

    "body" : "<h2>tl;dr</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Use latest IntelliJ, preferably installed automatically via the <em>JetBrains Toolbox</em> app.</li>\n<li>Let IntelliJ download a JDK for you.</li>\n<li>Ask IntelliJ to create a new project for you, to be managed by <em>Maven</em>.</li>\n<li>Click the green triangle shown in the gutter next to your <code>main</code> method.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternatively, you skip the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IDE</a> altogether, and just use command-line.</p>\n<h2>Details</h2>\n<p>Getting started with Java can be frustrating, as can learning a new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IDE</a> like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IntelliJ</a>. But both Java and IntelliJ are amazingly powerful and flexible technologies, and fun too, once you get past the speed bumps when starting out.</p>\n<p>I cannot tell from your description exactly where things went off the rails. So here are some instructions to try again.</p>\n<p>First be sure you have installed the latest version of IntelliJ.</p>\n<h2><em>JetBrains Toolbox</em> app</h2>\n<p>Tip: I highly recommend uninstalling if you installed IntelliJ manually. Then install <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>JetBrains Toolbox</em></a> app. That app installs a mini-menu that makes it <em>much</em> easier to install and upgrade versions of IntelliJ (and all the other products published by JetBrains).</p>\n<p>When you have the latest IntelliJ installed, then choose File &gt; New Project.  Use the first item in list <code>Java</code>. Try to make your dialog look something like this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/829N7bAT.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/829N7bAT.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of New Project\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Name</em> can be anything you want. This will be the name of the folder containing all your project files.</p>\n<p><em>Location</em> can be any folder you want. Generally best to have a single place where you keep all your project folders.</p>\n<p><em>Create Git repository</em> can be turned off, unchecked. Git as an advanced tool for remembering snapshots of your project over time. Not needed when just learning, or playing around.</p>\n<h2>Build System</h2>\n<p><em>Build System</em> (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_system_(software_development)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>) refers to a tool to help you with all the other tools needed to compile your code, obtain needed libraries (“dependencies”), track assets such as images, and package it all together into a final software <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">artifact</a> such as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JAR</a> file or a double-clickable (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">executable</a>) app.</p>\n<p>In the old days, every <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IDE</a> used their own proprietary build system. This created frustrating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vendor lock-in</a>. So people invented build systems defined outside any one particular IDE, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apache Ant</a> being one of the first in the Java ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Nowadays most Java developers use either <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Apache Maven</em></a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Gradle</em></a> as their build tools. Of those two, I suggest Maven as it is a bit simpler to get started with, however both are excellent tools. You seem to have chosen Gradle on your first attempt, but I suggest you try again with Maven. Notice that <em>Maven</em> option in screenshot above.</p>\n<p>Maven and Gradle are both supported by all the major IDEs: IntelliJ, Eclipse, and NetBeans. Maven and Gradle both work the very same way regardless of which IDE you happen to be using. You can easily move your Maven-driven or Gradle-driven project from one IDE to another. And your Maven-driven or Gradle-driven project can be shared with other programmers without regard for what IDE they happen to be using.</p>\n<h2>JDK</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JDK</a> is an implementation of the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java specifications</a>, along with developer tooling.</p>\n<p>Several vendors provide JDK products, though not all license the <em>Java™</em> moniker from the trademark owner <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oracle Corp</a>. These vendors include Amazon, BellSoft, Azul Systems, Microsoft, SAP, IBM, Red Hat, Oracle, Adoptium of the Eclipse Foundation, and more. All of these provide excellent products, thoroughly tested. Most of the products are based mostly, if not entirely, on the OpenJDK source code project.</p>\n<p>In our screenshot above, notice the <em>JDK</em> pop-up menu. From there you can choose a JDK you have already installed. Or choose the menu item asking IntelliJ to download a JDK from one of the subset of vendors listed above. If you have no particular vendor in mind, then I suggest choosing <em>Eclipse Temurin</em> from Adoptium of the Eclipse Foundation.</p>\n<p>Version 24 of Java is current. Versions 8, 11, 17, 21, and likely 25 are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">long-term support</a> versions.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Settings</h2>\n<p>These settings are <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">specific to Maven</a>.</p>\n<p><em>GroupId</em> will be the package name used to organize the Java files you write. The convention is to reverse the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">domain name</a> of your company’s URL, with your app name, such as <code>com.acme.powerapp</code>. If you have no domain name registered, just invent up to get going.</p>\n<p><em>ArtifactId</em> will be used in naming your final artifact. In this case, that artifact is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JAR</a> file.</p>\n<h2>Code editor</h2>\n<p>When you click <em>Create</em> to make your project, you should see a window like one below, with a list of created project files listed on the left.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mdfdt6OD.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mdfdt6OD.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of code editor window\" /></a></p>\n<p>Double-click <em>Main</em> to see the file that makes up the core of your Java app. There you will find a method named exactly <code>main</code>. By default, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JVM</a> looks for this method when starting to run your app.</p>\n<h2>Run your app</h2>\n<p>Notice the hollow green triangle in the gutter of the code editor, the one next to that <code>main</code> method we mentioned above. \uD83D\uDC49\uD83C\uDFFD <strong>To run your project, just click that green triangle.</strong> As your app executes, find its output in the <em>Run</em> pane at the bottom of the window shown above.</p>\n<h2><em>Sans</em> IDE, just command-line</h2>\n<p>To just get started, you can skip the IDE altogether, no IntelliJ.</p>\n<p>Just install a JDK. Without IntelliJ, I suggest using the command-line tool <a href=\"https://sdkman.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SDKMAN!</a> to quite easily locate, download, install, and uninstall a JDK on Linux, macOS, etc. Any version of Java 11 or later <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/330\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">will work for this exercise</a>.</p>\n<p>Use any text-editor to create a file such as this. The name of the file should match the name you declare for your class.</p>\n<p>Given this particular example, the containing file would be named exactly <code>HelloWorldApp.java</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class HelloWorldApp \n{\n    public static void main(String[] args) \n    {\n        System.out.println( &quot;Hello World!&quot; );\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Pass the path to that <code>.java</code> file to the <code>java</code> executable found in the <code>bin</code> folder of your installed JDK. Something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-bash prettyprint-override\"><code>java /Users/basil_dot_work/HelloWorldApp.java \n</code></pre>\n<p>You should then see this appear on your console:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello World!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Spice it up with the current time, and run again.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class HelloWorldApp {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println( &quot;Hello World! &quot; + java.time.ZonedDateTime.now() );\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello World! 2025-04-22T18:44:43.288814-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is actually happening here is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <code>java</code> program recognizes that a <code>.java</code> file is source code, and needs to be compiled. So the <code>java</code> utility calls upon the <code>javac</code> program to actually compile.</li>\n<li>The <code>javac</code> program compiles your <code>.java</code> file’s source code into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_class_file\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a class</a>. That class is cached in memory.</li>\n<li>The <code>java</code> program you originally executed then takes over again, to execute the <code>main</code> method found in the cached class.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For all the gory details, see <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/330\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>JEP 330: Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs</em></a>. And future versions of Java will enable a new student to write even less code for a simpler <em>Hello World</em> experience, per <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/495\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>JEP 495</em></a>.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/docs/specs/man/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">specifications for <code>java</code> &amp; <code>javac</code></a> programs at the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JDK 24 documentation</a> website.</p>\n<h2>More info</h2>\n<p>For more info, see <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Java Tutorials</em></a> provided free of cost by Oracle Corp, such as <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/application/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this page</a>.</p>\n<p>I also recommend the book <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-java/9781492091646/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Head First Java, 3rd Edition</em></a> by Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates, Trisha Gee.</p>\n<p>Have fun.</p>\n",
