    "title" : "How to export BigQuery query results directly to GCS without creating a temporary table (using Java client)",
    "body" : "<p>I'm currently aware that I can export a BigQuery query result to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) by first creating a temporary table and then performing an extract table operation on that temp table.</p>\n<p>However, I'm wondering if there’s any other way to export the query results directly to GCS — ideally without the need to create an intermediate table.</p>\n<p>I came across the <strong><a href=\"https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/export-statements#gcs_s3_export_option\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EXPORT DATA</a></strong>\nSQL statement, which seems to do exactly what I want. But I couldn’t find any support for this in the BigQuery Java client library — I don’t see a direct API or method to run an EXPORT DATA statement.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to execute this using the Java client (e.g., as a query job)? Or any other recommended way to export query results directly to GCS from Java without creating a temp table?</p>\n<p>Any help or examples would be appreciated!</p>\n<p>What I’ve tried:</p>\n<p>Creating a temporary table → extract table → GCS (works, but not ideal).</p>\n<p>Looked through BigQueryOptions, JobInfo, and ExtractJobConfiguration in the Java SDK.</p>\n<p>Tried to find an equivalent method for EXPORT DATA — couldn’t find one.</p>\n<p>Environment:</p>\n<p>BigQuery Java client library: com.google.cloud:google-cloud-bigquery:1.137.1</p>\n<p>Running on GCP environment</p>\n",
