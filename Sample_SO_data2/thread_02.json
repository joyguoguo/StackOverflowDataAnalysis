    "title" : "IntelliJ How to define Run/Debug Configuration Templates per module?",
    "body" : "<p>Is it achievable in any way, shape or form, to be able to create a JUnit Run/Debug Configuration template that has VM argument -javaagent and it being applied to only one of many modules?</p>\n<p>Basically, I have multiple modules and one is called acceptance-tests, and only in this module I am using an AspectJ weaver, thus needing an aspectjweaver -javaagent. In another module there are unit tests, but when running them from the IDE I don't want the VM argument with aspectjweaver -javaagent to propagate to these unit tests, because it only throws errors and nothing else.</p>\n<p>I am using the IntelliJ's &quot;green arrow&quot; runner to run test in various places in various amounts, thus the need for the template, but it is completely unnecessary in other modules.</p>\n<p>If need be, I can implement any other strategy that allows for restricting this VM argument to only one module. I tried attaching it to the currently running JVM, which works, but it is being attached after all classes are loaded so it doesn't weave anything...</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>\n",
