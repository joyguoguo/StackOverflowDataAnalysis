    "body" : "<p>If a GUI test must involve entering text in a text field, a convenient shortcut is <code>robot.enterText(..)</code> (available in both FEST and its fork, AssertJ Swing).</p>\n<p>I was under the impression the utility is smart enough to switch the keyboard layout if it doesn't match the text. Actually, it is not: all this time such a switch was done by my local utility application, Punto Switcher.</p>\n<p>It means such tests are dependent on the keyboard layout which is unacceptable.</p>\n<p>I know I can set a so-called &quot;input locale&quot; for any component which would in effect change the layout (<code>component.getInputContext().selectInputMethod(..)</code>). It would require explicitly setting the input locale in each such test before invoking <code>robot.enterText(..)</code>. However, I was wondering whether I could do it a better way.</p>\n<p>Note the text must be entered physically, not programmatically (<code>field.setText(..)</code>).</p>\n<p>What is the best way to address this?</p>\n",
