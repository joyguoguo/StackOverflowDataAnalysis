    "body" : "<p>I have written Java code that replicates a chess game. For the UI, I have used <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaadin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vaadin</a>. I'm trying to integrate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish_%28chess%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Stockfish</a> to my code.</p>\n<p>But from the below links.\n<a href=\"https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/16601/connecting-chess-engine-with-a-java-program\">Link 1</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/15704/what-is-the-optimal-way-to-use-stockfish-programmatically/15707#15707\">Link 2</a></p>\n<p>It seems like I have to run a software locally and then interact with a process. But I want the game to be standalone. So I'm not sure which system it will be used.</p>\n<p>How will I resolve this? If I add all the three engines to my bundle, it will make it heavy.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to get integrate as a library rather than running as a separate software? How?</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>Stockfish is a C++ programmed software so it's not simple to integrate into a Java code base. You have a few alternatives like Java Native Interface or Java Native Access but if you are not familiar with it, it can become quite complex for non trivial projects.<br />\nIt could possibly be simpler to create a ProcessBuilder to launch the binary and use Input and Output readers/writers to manage the Stockfish out as it was being used from the terminal (send/write/type input and read the output/stdout/stderr).</p>\n",

But if you absolutely need your thing to be self-contained - then yeah, you'd have to ship binaries for all systems you support and detect what you're running on.</p>\n",
