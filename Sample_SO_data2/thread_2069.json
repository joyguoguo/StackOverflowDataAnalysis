    "title" : "Is there a way to add a grading category when creating coursework using the Google Classroom API?",
    "body" : "<p>When creating coursework via the Google Classroom API, there is a method called <code>setGradeCategory()</code>, which takes a grade category object as input. When setting the grade category, the assignment is created successfully, but no grade category is applied to it. I have to manually go into Google Classroom and set it myself.</p>\n<p>For example, if I create a grade category object and pass it in, the assignment is created, but the grade category is still showing as blank when I retrieve the assignment via a <code>GET</code> or look at it in Google Classroom. Below are valid grade category attributes that currently exist for the course I am creating the assignment for:</p>\n<pre><code>GradeCategory gradeCategory = new GradeCategory();gradeCategory.setDefaultGradeDenominator(40);gradeCategory.setId(&quot;785124763466&quot;);gradeCategory.setName(&quot;Homework&quot;);gradeCategory.setWeight(4000);\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>CourseWork content = new CourseWork().setTitle(assignmentTitle).setDescription(&quot;Test Assignment&quot;).setMaterials(materials).setMaxPoints(maxPoints).setGradeCategory(gradeCategory).setWorkType(&quot;ASSIGNMENT&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The assignment is created successfully.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Grade category is blank when viewing the newly created assignment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "body" : "<p>The short answer to the question is <strong>No</strong>. As per <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/workspace/classroom/reference/rest/v1/courses.courseWork\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">REST Resource: courses.courseWork</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>object (<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/workspace/classroom/reference/rest/v1/GradeCategory\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GradeCategory</a>)</p>\n<p>The category that this coursework's grade contributes to. Present only when a category has been chosen for the coursework. May be used in calculating the overall grade.</p>\n<p>Read-only.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This indicates that while the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/workspace/classroom/reference/rest/v1/courses.courseWork/create\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Method: courses.courseWork.create</a> <em><strong>takes a grade category object as input</strong></em>, it's expected that <em><strong>no grade category is applied</strong></em> to the created coursework since it's currently designed to be <strong>Read-only.</strong></p>\n<p>I found <a href=\"https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/311356896\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ability to modify <code>gradebookSettings</code> and <code>gradeCategories</code> via <code>course.create</code> and/or <code>course.patch</code></a> on Google's Issue Tracker, which has a similar issue as yours. You may <code>+1</code> on it to let Google know you're also requesting the same feature.</p>\n<p>My guess is that the reason why the API allows the creation of coursework with the <code>gradeCategory</code> as part of the <strong>Request body</strong> is because they'll have that added in the future.</p>\n",
