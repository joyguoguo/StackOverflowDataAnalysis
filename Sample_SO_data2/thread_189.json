    "title" : "m2e Workspace Resolution Broken After Upgrading from Eclipse 2021 to 2025",
    "body" : "<p>I’m upgrading an old Eclipse setup and ran into a strange issue with m2e workspace resolution.</p>\n<p>I moved from <strong>Eclipse 2021</strong> to <strong>Eclipse 2025</strong>.<br />\nI created a completely clean Eclipse installation and workspace, imported all my projects, and installed all required plugins.</p>\n<p>However, I now have this problem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Project A has a Maven dependency on Project B (declared in A's pom.xml)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If Project B is open in the workspace, then Project A cannot resolve imports or references to Project B</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If Project B is closed, then Project A compiles fine (but now under Maven Dependencies the jar of Project B is present, not the project folder)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If I disable &quot;Resolve dependencies from workspace projects&quot; in Project A it also works, but this slows down development, as I have to build Project B after each change for Project A to pick up the changes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So workspace resolution itself seems broken.</p>\n<p>Edit: I have tried updating maven projects (Alt + f5) and cleaning repeatedly and I have an external maven installation configured. The errors I see are both in the code itself, and in the problems view of eclipse. I am not using code generation.</p>\n",

Well, I suggest that you (in case you haven&#39;t done already) create from scratch a simple example of two projects related by their POMs, with workspace resolution enabled. If it works, then compare the Eclipse metadata (.project, .classpath, .settings) of the new projects with the imported ones. And if it does not, then throw your new Eclipse to the trash and look for another version.",
