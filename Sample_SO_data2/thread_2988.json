    "title" : "NetBeans is glitching and calling a method that isn&#39;t there",
    "body" : "<p>I'm doing homework for a Data Structures class and making a 2-3 tree in NetBeans, but there's a glitch that keeps happening where a method is called twice, but the second time, it's being called by a statement that isn't there.</p>\n<p>This is the method that is being called by the main class, <code>main.Tree23.insert()</code>. It's line 33 in my Tree23 class.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QsHjTzMn.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QsHjTzMn.png\" alt=\"method named insert() inside the class Tree23. Code is running in debug mode with line 46 highlighted as a callstack line where current.insertItem(data) is being called.\" /></a></p>\n<p>Here is the call stack correctly listing the method calls so far:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8QqF9mTK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8QqF9mTK.png\" alt=\"Call stack displaying, from bottom to top, Tree23Remixed.main line 16, Tree23.insert line 46, and Node23.insertItem line 63.\" /></a></p>\n<p>But then, for no discernible reason, the method is called again and the line it calls is not even there. There's clearly blank space in line 51.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UXP56lED.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UXP56lED.png\" alt=\"method named insert() inside the class Tree23.

I have no idea how to troubleshoot this. What could be causing this glitch?</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>I haven't used NetBeans a lot before, but I researched a bit for finding a proper solution. I think common sense debugging techniques should work, for example:</p>\n<p>- Try copying your entire code in a fresh file and run it again, as some files are simply corrupted. Additional to this, you could run your code on a different editor; this way, you'll see if the problem occurs on NetBeans itself or if it is indeed a problem with your code.</p>\n<p>- As the comment on your post said, you should also try <strong>cleaning and rebuilding</strong> your project. I haven't used this feature before, but as this post from Stack Overflow suggests: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32603274/netbeans-8-0-2-clean-and-build-then-run-results-in-old-code-being-run\">Netbeans 8.0.2 Clean and Build then Run results in old code being run</a>, try going on BUILD and then CLEAN AND BUILD PROJECT (or use command &quot;Shift + F11&quot;). If this is not how it is displayed on your platform setup, try the way @markspace suggested, and I quote: &lt;&lt;Pick &quot;Clean&quot; from the menu at the top, then &quot;Build&quot; the entire project again.&gt;&gt;.</p>\n<p>- Another thing that could cause the problem, although I doubt this is the root of the bug, is to check if the debugger is not causing misleading stack traces by checking its settings.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS TO @markspace for the second suggestion I offered in my answer.</strong></p>\n",
