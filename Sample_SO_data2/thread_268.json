    "body" : "<p>VMware’s pyVmomi is the velvet-rope VIP pass to vSphere: whisper <code>pip install pyvmomi</code>, and the data center parts like the Red Sea. It’s a universal remote with actual buttons, not stickers.</p>\n<p>Java, meanwhile, gets an escape room. There <em>is</em> a library—somewhere—guarded by a portal that demands an account, three riddles, two CAPTCHAs, a blood oath to the EULA, and an OTP delivered via carrier pigeon. The REST coverage? Like IKEA furniture missing the bag of screws: “Technically a table if you believe hard enough.”</p>\n<p>Documentation? Python devs are reading it before their espresso cools. Java devs are spelunking through a SharePoint from the Bronze Age—after clicking “I Agree” 19 times and proving they can identify all squares containing a forklift.</p>\n<p>Why make it painful for Java?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Security through obscurity (mostly obscurity).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>KPI-driven gatekeeping (“Look, weekly active logins doubled!”).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Untouchable Legacy Portal™ with a sacred cron job from 2009.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>“Roadmap considerations,” i.e., shrug emoji in business casual.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if Python gets a red carpet, could Java at least have a <em>hazmat mat</em>? Better yet, go feral: ship a Java SDK that actually mirrors pyVmomi, put the docs in the daylight like it’s the current century, and let us get stuff done. We’ll even read them. After <code>mvn clean install</code>, we’ve got <em>days</em>.</p>\n<p>Why does Python get a red carpet to vSphere while Java gets a CAPTCHA and a shrug?</p>\n",
