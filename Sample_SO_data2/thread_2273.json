    "body" : "<p>I am having difficulties with the following scenario.</p>\n<p>I have an API that generates tokens and responds with an HTTPOnly cookie. This API is in a development environment (Cloud Server) at the URL <code>https://example.com/api</code>.</p>\n<p>I am developing a React application locally that needs to call this API to generate the token. So far, everything is working.</p>\n<p>The cookie is set as <code>HttpOnly</code>, <code>Secure</code>, and <code>SameSite=None</code> and I see in my API's response that the <code>Set-Cookie</code> comes with the domain set to <code>example.com</code> (here's the problem).</p>\n<p>Therefore, when my React application, which is running on <code>localhost</code>, tries to make a request to another API that is also on <code>localhost</code>, the cookie does not reach it.</p>\n<p>The scenario I expect is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My React application generates the token in the API running on the\nserver at the URL <code>https://example.com/api</code>.</li>\n<li>The server responds, and the cookies are set.</li>\n<li>My React application makes a request to another API that is running\nlocally, and the cookies are sent to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When everything is running locally, it works, but I do not want to have to run all the applications locally for it to succeed; I want to run only those that are in development.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to handle cookies when executing applications on localhost?</p>\n",
