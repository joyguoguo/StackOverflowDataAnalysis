    "body" : "<p>I'm using SerenityBDD on a very mature project, included in this projects we have two different UI application and API tests for a countless amount of services.</p>\n<p>When I'm writing cucumber tests in IntelliJ the dropdown menu appears and it shows every single possible step:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there any way to make IntelliJ only show steps for particular application or service?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Or to show an error if you've accidently used a step from the wrong application?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Similarly when you start writing the test, is there any way to specify what steps can come next after a step?\nI.e., the user has logged in and will be on X page, these are all the steps that can be called from that page.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Splitting into separate projects isn't really an option.</p>\n<p>You might be able to tell that the framework I used previously would call methods directly, and with Java it was easy to specify <code>PageObjects</code> in method returns to chain them together.</p>\n<p>It was very easy to write tests and friendly to new people.</p>\n<p>I found the way that serenity/cucumber are doing this to be very unfriendly when it just shows every single step that exists.</p>\n",

    "body" : "Splitting into separate projects is an option. Probably your only option. If done correctly step definitions can be a relatively thin connection between feature files and the code code that interacts with the SUT. So some duplication there is okay. Ideally, if reused often, the code that interacts with the SUT is then extracted into a library that these different projects use.",
