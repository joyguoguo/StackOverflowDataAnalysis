    "title" : "Can we traverse stack in FIFO order without custom logic?",
    "body" : "<p>My teammate asked if we can traverse stack in FIFO (First In First Out) order. I say stack itself maintain LIFO order in it but we can traverse it in FIFO manner by using another stack or list. Then we asked the same question with chatgpt. I will discuss one of the solutions Chatgpt provided me. In stack we can call method iterator() which return iterator on the stack. And when we iterate, I was expecting that the answer will be in LIFO order but the actual answer will displayed on IDE is FIFO which makes me amaze. Is this an implementation issue from the side of Java or Oracle? Or is it intentional?</p>\n<p>Using Iterator:</p>\n<pre><code>Stack&lt;Integer&gt; stack = new Stack&lt;&gt;();\nstack.push(10);\nstack.push(20);\nstack.push(30);\nstack.push(40);\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Iterating using Stack's iterator (LIFO order):&quot;);\nIterator&lt;Integer&gt; iterator = stack.iterator();\nwhile (iterator.hasNext()) {\n    System.out.println(iterator.next());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using Pop method:</p>\n<pre><code>Stack&lt;Integer&gt; stack = new Stack&lt;&gt;();\nstack.push(10);\nstack.push(20);\nstack.push(30);\nstack.push(40);\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Iterating using Stack's pop method&quot;);\nwhile (stack.size()&gt;0) {\n    System.out.println(stack.pop());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>After doing R&amp;D, I understand that the iterator() method belongs to vector which stack inherited. So it's implementation came from vector not from stack.</p>\n<p>I just want to know that is this right behavior? Java says that its stack follows LIFO order and on the other hand we can traverse it in FIFO order. iterator() method should be override in stack by default and there should be no way to traverse stack by FIFO order inside Java.</p>\n<p>Kindly explain your thought on this issue. I am not saying Java is wrong. I just want to know current behavior of stack is ok or there can be an improvement?</p>\n",

It extends class Vector with five operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This behaviour is expected and correct, the stack is behaving exactly as documented - a vector being masked as a LIFO structure.

Array deques have no capacity restrictions; they grow as necessary to support usage. They are not thread-safe; in the absence of external synchronization, they do not support concurrent access by multiple threads. Null elements are prohibited.
