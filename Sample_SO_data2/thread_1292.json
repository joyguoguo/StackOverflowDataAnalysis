    "body" : "<p>We're building a Flutter app that should automatically open a specific screen (e.g., AlarmScreen) when the device is plugged into power (ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED), even if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The app is closed (killed),</li>\n<li>The app is in the background,</li>\n<li>Or the screen is off/locked.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We implemented a native Android BroadcastReceiver that checks a flag (state.txt = 1), and launches the app with:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>launch.putExtra(&quot;openAlarm&quot;, true);\nlaunch.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);\ncontext.startActivity(launch);\nIn Flutter’s MainActivity, we call:\n</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>setShowWhenLocked(true);\nsetTurnScreenOn(true);\nWe pass the openAlarm flag using MethodChannel in onNewIntent().\n</code></pre>\n<p>In Flutter (Dart):</p>\n<p>On app startup, we call platform.invokeMethod(&quot;checkIntent&quot;) and navigate to AlarmScreen if true.</p>\n<p>We also handle MethodChannel.setMethodCallHandler to catch &quot;onNewIntent&quot;.</p>\n<h5>We expected:</h5>\n<p>That AlarmScreen would always open when openAlarm=true is received via intent — even if the app was backgrounded or killed.</p>\n<h5>What actually happens:</h5>\n<p>If the app is already running → everything works.</p>\n<p>If the app is in background or was killed → MainActivity receives the correct intent, but AlarmScreen does not open.</p>\n<p>Logs confirm the intent arrives with openAlarm=true, and MethodChannel is called.</p>\n<p>We believe Flutter is not yet &quot;ready&quot; to push a screen at that moment.</p>\n",
