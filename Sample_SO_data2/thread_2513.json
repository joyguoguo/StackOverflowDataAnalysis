    "body" : "<p>I'm interested in the warnings which are potentially reported by a webhook in k8s. When connecting to the k8s cluster using the Fabric8 k8s client, those warnings are ignored. I believe I need to implement a custom vert.x http client (using fabric8s 7.2.0's default client) and catch the warning headers. However, I can't figure out how to override the default client. Can't find any docs. Please help me solve by providing any pointers are a complete implementation of the missing code. This is used in the context of a Quarkus app so I'm curious to provide a custom implementation through cdi.</p>\n<pre><code>@ApplicationScoped\npublic class KubernetesClientProducer {\n    private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(&quot;KubernetesClientProducer&quot;);\n\n    @Produces\n    public KubernetesClient kubernetesClient() {\n        Config config = new ConfigBuilder().build();\n\n        .........\n\n        return new KubernetesClientBuilder()\n                .withConfig(config)\n                .withHttpClientFactory(factory)\n                .build();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n",
