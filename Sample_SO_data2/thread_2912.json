    "body" : "<p><a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3151\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RFC 3151</a> provides a way to encode general public ids to URNs. For example, <code>-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN</code> becomes <code>urn:publicid:-:OASIS:DTD+DocBook+XML+V4.1.2:EN</code>.</p>\n<p>Is there a facility in the Java standard library that allows to translate such strings? Something like <code>Translator.toUrn(&quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN&quot;))</code> that would yield the URI <code>urn:publicid:-:OASIS:DTD+DocBook+XML+V4.1.2:EN</code>?</p>\n<p>Otherwise, can I reduce implementation complexity of the RFC algorithm by reusing some already existing logic? For example, it feels like encoding <code>;</code> to <code>%3B</code> and the like should already be implemented somewhere.</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>Worth mentioning that this URL-friendly alternative syntax is also part of ISO 8879 (SGML) Annex K (ISO 8879:1986/Cor 2:1999) aka The WebSGML Additions defining XML 1.0 as a profile of SGML and adding features (eg. XML-style empty elements) but mostly means to express restrictions introduced with XML (eg. requirement for a document to be fully-tagged) (see <a href=\"https://sgmljs.net/docs/sgmlrefman.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sgmljs - SGML Syntax Reference</a> for details and the official SGML declaration for XML 1.0 up to 4th ed. at the end). Hence, even though <code>URN YES</code> is <em>not</em> part of the SGML declaration for XML, you may have luck finding support for URN syntax in old Java XML parsers, but I doubt it. As mentioned in the linked SGML syntax reference, sgmljs <em>does</em> support URN syntax for formal public identifiers; it's not a very complex task to implement it on top of regular public identifier and generic URL parsers/encoders.</p>\n",
