    "title" : "Java Spring container with Feign client not logging in AWS fargate",
    "body" : "<p>I have a strange issue with my Spring container on AWS. When I run the container on my local machine everything works as expected. When I run the container as a standalone task on Fargate it seems to get stuck as soon as the Feign client code gets executed. The worst is, there are no errors or anything else that would point me in any direction. The application just seems to hang up. Only thing I can confirm via flow logs is that the client does not establish a connection to the outside.</p>\n<p>I have tested the connectivity with the Apache http client. The target URL is available from inside the container. And up until the point where the Feign client gets executed I can see logs just fine.</p>\n<p>Since the code runs locally I would rule out an issue with the code in general. So I am suspecting a configuration issue or the container itself. My Dockerfile looks like this</p>\n<pre><code>ARG platform=linux/amd64\nFROM --platform=${platform} maven:3.9.5-amazoncorretto-17 AS build\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY . .\nRUN mvn clean package -B -C -ntp\n\nFROM --platform=${platform} amazoncorretto:17-al2-jdk\nENV PROFILE=aws\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar\nENTRYPOINT [&quot;java&quot;,&quot;-Dspring.profiles.active=${PROFILE}&quot;,&quot;/app/app.jar&quot;]\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've wasted more time on this than I want to admit. What can I try next?</p>\n",
