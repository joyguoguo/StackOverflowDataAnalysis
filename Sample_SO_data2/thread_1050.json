    "title" : "sourceCompatibility and targetCompatibility of Java 11 in Flutter apps for support upto Android 7 (API 24)",
    "body" : "<p>This is what my <code>android/app/build.gradle.kts</code> file looks like (only a portion shown):</p>\n<pre><code>android {\n    ... ...\n    ... ...\n    compileOptions {\n        sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11\n        targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11\n    }\n    ... ...\n    ... ...\n} \n</code></pre>\n<p>The project uses default values for other important config options, which are determined by file <code>&lt;flutter_install_dir&gt;/packages/flutter_tools/gradle/src/main/kotlin/FlutterExtension.kt</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>open class FlutterExtension {\n    val compileSdkVersion: Int = 36\n    val minSdkVersion: Int = 24\n    val targetSdkVersion: Int = 36\n    val ndkVersion: String = &quot;27.0.12077973&quot;\n    ... ...\n    ... ...\n    ... ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The AGP version is: <code>&quot;8.9.1&quot;</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use this table to determine which Java version is supported by each Android API, and where to find details on which Java APIs are available.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/build/jdks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source: Java versions in Android builds</a>)</p>\n<pre><code>Android        Java\n14 (API 34)    17\n13 (API 33)    11\n12 (API 32)    11\n</code></pre>\n<h3>UPDATE:</h3>\n<p><strong>My Question Previously (now changed to that follows this):</strong>\nI am trying to understand what <code>sourceCompatibility</code> and <code>targetCompatibility</code> options are in order to be able to configure them properly for my projects. As you can see my project targets <code>API 36</code> but the Java version used is <code>VERSION_11</code>. So, I suppose this table given in official documentation shows <code>maximum supported Java version</code>! Please correct me if I am wrong. I read somewhere that <em>source</em> and <em>target compatibility</em> of Java also determines the Android Runtime (ART). How to select these versions for (1) scalability, (2) latest features?</p>\n<p><strong>My Updated Question:</strong></p>\n<p>According to the documentation (<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/build/jdks#compileSdk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Which Java APIs can I use in my Java or Kotlin source code?</a> and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54129834/which-android-versions-run-which-java-versions\">Which Android versions run which Java versions?</a>), the supported Java APIs for Android versions are:</p>\n<pre><code> Android           Java\n 14 (API 34)       17\n 13 (API 33)       11\n 11,12 (API 31,32) 11\n  7 (API 24,25)     8\n2-6 (AIP 9-23)      6\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since, my minSdkVersion is <code>24</code> I would tend to think that Java version 8 is the appropriate for my project to support the lowest possible Android version. However, when I changed the <code>sourceCompatibility</code> and <code>targetCompatibility</code> to <code>VERSION_1_8</code> (Java version 8), I started getting the following warnings:</p>\n<pre><code>warning: [options] source value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release\nwarning: [options] target value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release\n</code></pre>\n<p>Currently, API 24 seems to be the recommended minSdk (as this is default with Flutter 3.35.x) and so I don't want to set my minSdk to <code>32</code> and use Java 11.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I support down till Android 7 (API 24) with Java 11?</strong></p>\n<h4>Notes:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Google seems to have removed support for API 24 emulators. Though I could still install the emulator, I could not install package that was build with minSdk=24 support. Surprising! Similarly, emulators upto API 30 (Android 11) were unsupported as I tested them on Sep. 02, 2025.</li>\n<li>Finally, I tested with API 31 (Android 12), and this was supported and could also run the app which was compiled minSdk of <code>24</code>!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Stats on Android device usage suggest if Android 12, is what we base out minSdk version we would be loosing a lot of devices:</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mdPt3A8D.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mdPt3A8D.png\" alt=\"stats counter stats graph\" /></a></p>\n",
