    "body" : "When using an IDE, you need to understand how its build system works and how to control it. Don&#39;t let <i>it</i> control <i>you</i>. Netbeans traditionally used Ant and I suspect still does. Setting your target release to 24 will give you the latest features but will likely prevent your software being used elsewhere. The sensible choice is to compile to the <i>lowest</i> runtime version practicable for your codebase. My release version is often 9. 8 is really <i>too</i> low as it&#39;s really &#39;pre-watershed&#39;. Were I to use Netbeans, I&#39;d probably only use Maven projects and use Maven directly, though you could use GUI",
