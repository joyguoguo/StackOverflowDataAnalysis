    "body" : "<p>I'm working on a Spring Framework project and recently upgraded the Java SDK from 11 to 17. After upgrading to Java 17, everything worked fine — the project built successfully, deployed without issues, and ran properly in production.</p>\n<p>However, while working locally with Java SDK 11, I tried running the same project and encountered the following error:</p>\n<pre><code>org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanDefinitionStoreException: Failed to parse configuration class [com.test.commerce.front.controller.etc.CommerceController]; \nnested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not resolve placeholder 'spring.profiles.active' in value &quot;classpath:commerce-ec-${spring.profiles.active}.properties&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This error points to a line in my configuration class using @PropertySource:</p>\n<pre><code>@PropertySource(&quot;classpath:commerce-ec-${spring.profiles.active}.properties&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Switching back to Java 17 and rebuilding resolves the issue, and the application starts without any problem. I initially thought this might be a local environment issue, but I tested the same behavior on our development server — and it fails the same way with Java 11.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t find any documentation or references indicating that placeholder resolution behavior for @PropertySource differs between Java versions.\nIs there any known difference in how Spring handles property resolution with @PropertySource between Java 11 and Java 17?</p>\n<p>Any insight would be appreciated.</p>\n",
