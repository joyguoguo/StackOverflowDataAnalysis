    "body" : "<p>I am using Quartz jdbcjobstore to manage a set of distributed jobs within a java application. I am having a problem when I deploy code that contains a new <code>org.quartz.Job</code> implementation.</p>\n<p>When I am deploying a new version of my application, I will do a canary deploy, where the new tag of my code will run alongside the old version for a short while. When the new version of my code starts running, it will notice that a desired Job is not present in the Quartz scheduler, and schedule it.</p>\n<p>However, if I still have old versions of my application running, they will sometimes attempt to pick up this new job, but throw a ClassNotFoundException because the new Job's class is not present in the old tag of my application. This will put the job into the ERROR state, and it will stop running.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to indicate to Quartz that the old instances should not attempt to run the new Job?</p>\n",
