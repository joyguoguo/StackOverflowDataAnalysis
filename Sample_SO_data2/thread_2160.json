    "body" : "<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.java.com/en/download/help/firefox_java.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this page</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Firefox no longer provides NPAPI support (technology required for Java applets)</p>\n<p>As of September, 2018, Firefox no longer offers a version which supports NPAPI, the technology required to run Java applets. The Java Plugin for web browsers relies on the cross-platform plugin architecture NPAPI, which had been supported by all major web browsers for over a decade. The 64 bit version of Firefox has never supported NPAPI, and Firefox version 52ESR is the last release to support the technology. It is below the security baseline, and no longer supported.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if you wanted Java support in Firefox in RHEL 8 you would have to locate, download and install a 32-bit version of Firefox 52ESR (or older) and a 32-bit version of Java 8.  And even then, there is no guarantee that it will work.</p>\n<p>AFAIK, all modern alternative browsers have similar problems.  (And you can't run Internet Explorer natively on a Linux box, even if you were crazy enough to want to.)</p>\n<p>My advice would be to drop this idea.  Java applets are dead technology.</p>\n<p>Alternatives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If it is your code, consider rewriting it as a Swing or JavaFX application or as a Flutter web app or an HTML 5 native application or something.</li>\n<li>You might be able to get an applet to work using the <a href=\"https://cheerpj.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CheerpJ Applet Runner</a>.</li>\n<li>You might be able to get it to run from a command prompt using the Java 8 <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/appletviewer.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">appletviewer</a> tool.</li>\n<li>You might be able to get it to launch from a browser using Java Web Start (deprecated), or its successor <a href=\"https://openwebstart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OpenWebStart</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n",
