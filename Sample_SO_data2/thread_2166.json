    "title" : "Long startup times for Java Language support in VS Code with Flutter project",
    "body" : "<p>I have a top-level folder <code>project</code> that contains folders named <code>mobile</code> and <code>server</code>.  Inside the <code>mobile</code> folder is a Flutter app, and inside the <code>server</code> folder is a Spring Boot app.</p>\n<p>When I open the <code>project</code> folder in Visual Studio Code, the Java Language extension tells me that it's &quot;Opening Java Projects&quot; which takes an extremely long time.  Recently it's started causing an <code>OutOfMemoryException</code>.  I am using version 0.29.1 of the Extension Pack for Java from Microsoft.</p>\n<p>I've noticed while it's importing it says it's <em>Configuring projects :device_info_plus</em>.  That is a Flutter package, so it seems like it should be ignored.  It does this for many if not all of the Flutter packages the project is using.</p>\n<p>At the suggestion of Google search / ChapGPT, I added the following configuration to <code>project/.vscode/settings.json</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;java.project.resourcesFilters&quot;: [\n  &quot;android/&quot;\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unfortunately this hasn't changed the behavior.</p>\n<p>I stumbled upon a log file in <code>AppData\\Roaming\\Code\\User\\workspaceStorage\\...\\redhat.java\\jdt_ws\\.metadata\\.log</code> which has entries in it like this:</p>\n<pre><code>!MESSAGE Could not write metadata for '/path_provider_android'.\n!STACK 0\njava.io.FileNotFoundException: very log path\\3.tree (The system cannot find the path specified) \n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm not sure if this is related.</p>\n<p>Should the Java Language server be processing Flutter packages?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If not</strong>, what is the proper <code>resourceFilter</code> path to specify that will prevent them from being processed?</li>\n<li><strong>If so</strong>, is there any way to speed up the start up time for opening up this folder?</li>\n</ul>\n",
