    "title" : "Issue with Instantiating CsvValidator.ValidatorBuilder Due to Package-Private Access in csv-validator-java-api",
    "body" : "<p>I've been working with the <a href=\"https://github.com/digital-preservation/csv-validator\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>csv-validator-java-api</code></a> and came across a potential discrepancy in its documentation (or maybe I misunderstood how to use it). According to the <a href=\"https://github.com/digital-preservation/csv-validator/tree/master\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">documentation</a>, the inner static class <code>ValidatorBuilder</code> can be instantiated directly using:</p>\n<pre><code>CsvValidator.ValidatorBuilder validateWithReaders = new CsvValidator.ValidatorBuilder(\n    csvReader, csvSchemaReader\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, upon reviewing the implementation on GitHub, it appears that <code>ValidatorBuilder</code> is marked as package-private. This means it cannot be accessed directly outside its package. Here is the relevant section of the code: <code>CsvValidator.java</code>(<a href=\"https://github.com/digital-preservation/csv-validator/blob/master/csv-validator-java-api/src/main/java/uk/gov/nationalarchives/csv/validator/api/java/CsvValidator.java#L198\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/digital-preservation/csv-validator/blob/master/csv-validator-java-api/src/main/java/uk/gov/nationalarchives/csv/validator/api/java/CsvValidator.java#L198</a>) on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Given this contradiction, I'd appreciate any guidance on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there an oversight in the documentation regarding the accessibility of <code>ValidatorBuilder</code> as it seems to be the <em>right</em> entry point for the validator creation ?</li>\n<li>How can I correctly implement validation using csv-validator-java-api without direct access to <code>ValidatorBuilder</code>, or what is the intended approach?</li>\n<li>Should the visibility of <code>ValidatorBuilder</code> be adjusted in the implementation, or is there another way to access its functionality?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any insights on how to resolve or workaround this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>\n",
