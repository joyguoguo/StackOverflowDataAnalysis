    "body" : "<p>We have a project with Java 17, Spring Boot 2.7.18 and Spring 5.3.37. I upgraded it to Spring Boot to 3.4.3 and Spring to 6.2.3. When the application was run, a ClassNotFoundException (for the class javax.xml.ws.Service) was thrown by one of my company's internal library. I tried searching for a solution, and it seems that the recommended solution was to download the dependencies com.sun.xml.ws:jaxws-rt and com.sun.xml.ws:rt. Below is one of the links I found.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68088980/classnotfoundexception-javax-xml-ws-service\">ClassNotFoundException: javax.xml.ws.Service</a></p>\n<p>I have downloaded these two dependencies, but they didn't make any difference when the application is run. The same exception is still thrown. What I don't really get it is this: why were these two dependencies suggested when they both don't contain the class javax.xml.ws.Service?</p>\n<p>Is finding a newer version of the internal library that is throwing the exception my only solution?</p>\n",
