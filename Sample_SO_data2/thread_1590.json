    "body" : "<p>I'm not exactly sure what the issue was, but I fixed it as follows:</p>\n<p>After @MarkRotteveel's suggestion to uninstall the TextMate Keymap plugin, I checked my plugins for it. I didn't have it installed, but I did have TextMate Bundle and Eclipse Keymap, Visual Keymap and NetBeans keymap.</p>\n<p>I disabled ALL of those, after which my IDE informed me my .java files were re-associated to text files and offered me to change the file association.</p>\n<p>As per my original question, the files had the icon as if they were normal text files, however previously they still showed appropriate syntax colors and such. This was no longer the case (I believe because TextMate Bundle was now disabled?).</p>\n<p>In the settings &gt; Editor &gt; File Types I found &quot;Text&quot; and indeed it had *.java listed in it's file name patterns. I can not tell if this has always been the case, if so, likely this might've been the root of the issue all along. I deleted *.java from it's file name patterns, after which all my files immediately received the correct icon I was expecting and everything that had previously not worked now works!</p>\n<p>I re-enabled the plugins as well, and it still works as intended.</p>\n",
