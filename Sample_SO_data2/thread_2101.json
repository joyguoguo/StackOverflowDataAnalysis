The development went smooth until the refund part, the thing is I can't import some classes from the library, in Android Studio it shows to me in both class finder or suggestion, but when I try to import even with * I get unreferenced class.</p>\n<p>I noticed all the classes I'm having this problem are in a public folder in the library. My assumption is that since public is a reserved word, the project is getting lost:</p>\n<pre><code>com.zoop.pos.plugin.public.requestBuilder.VoidTransactionResponse\ncom.zoop.pos.plugin.public.requestBuilder.MenuOptions\ncom.zoop.pos.plugin.public.requestBuilder.LastReceiptResponse\ncom.zoop.pos.plugin.public.requestBuilder.PixPaymentResponse\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0pQ55ACY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0pQ55ACY.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CKp0hSrk.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CKp0hSrk.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Is there any way to use this class without requiring any development from the other company?</p>\n",

The fact that the author of this library has chosen to use &quot;public&quot; might be because they specifically want to make it impossible to call their classes from Java. If that&#39;s not the case, they should be alerted to the fact that their library cannot be called from Java, and they should change their package name. If they won&#39;t, you could try writing a Kotlin wrapper as Khar Varsha suggested in an <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/79651609/13963086\">answer</a> which Dalija Prasnikar later deleted for some unknown reason.",
