    "body" : "<p>I have a chess game that opens a jpanel in order to play and im having trouble trying to dockerize it. I'm very new to docker and I've run in to a multitude of errors that wont allow me to create the image. The issue seems to be with x11 forwarding and I've tried researching many articles and going through many stackoverflow questions but none of them seem to help. This is currently my dockerfile:</p>\n<pre><code>FROM openjdk:25-slim\n\nRUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y \\\n    libx11-6 \\\n    libxext6 \\\n    libxrender1 \\\n    libxtst6 \\\n    libxi6 \\\n    &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\nR\n\nWORKDIR /MyChessGame\n\nCOPY target/MyChessGame-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar .\n\nENV DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0\n\nENTRYPOINT [&quot;java&quot;, &quot;-jar&quot;, &quot;MyChessGame-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar&quot;]\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this specific file I get the error of &quot;Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.awt.AWTError: Can't connect to X11 window server using 'host.docker.internal:0.0' as the value of the DISPLAY variable.&quot; I'm running it through simple command of Docker run &lt;image_name&gt;. I haven't seen anyone online that has done it for a pure java project, please help. And any tips on the file overall would be greatly appreciated, thank you all.</p>\n",

Note that this is tricky to run, requires the Linux display system specifically, and requires a package (Docker) that&#39;s not preinstalled on the host system; your end users will probably have a better time installing a JVM if they don&#39;t already have one and running your application without Docker.",
