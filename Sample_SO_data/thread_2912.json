    "title" : "How to achieve SSO with JavaFX WebView using OAuth 2.0 Federated Authentication in a Java Desktop Application (Java 21)?",
    "body" : "<p>I have a standalone Windows desktop application built using Java Swing, running on Java 21. For authentication, we are using OAuth 2.0 federated authentication.</p>\n<p>Currently, the login page is launched in the system's default browser. After successful authentication, the user is redirected to a localhost URL (e.g., <code>http://localhost:8888</code>) with an authorization code, which the application then exchanges for an access token.</p>\n<p>This approach works, but it opens the browser separately, and the redirect shows up as a blank <code>localhost</code> page. To work around this, I initially tried terminating the browser process after receiving the token, but that ends up closing the entire browser, including all open tabs — which is not acceptable.</p>\n<p>To provide a better user experience, I attempted to embed the login flow within the application itself using a JavaFX <code>WebView</code>. However, I'm running into issues during authentication. It seems like the <code>WebView</code> isn't able to leverage the user's existing OS session for SSO.</p>\n<p>In .NET, there's an option to pass a flag like <code>AllowSingleSignOnUsingOSPrimaryAccount</code> to enable SSO with the primary OS account.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6HuWK07B.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">localhost</a></p>\n<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there a way to achieve single sign-on using JavaFX <code>WebView</code>, similar to how it's done in .NET?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Is there any support in Java (or JavaFX specifically) for leveraging the OS-level primary account for SSO?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Are there alternative approaches to embedding the authentication experience within the application while still supporting SSO?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any guidance or best practices would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n",
