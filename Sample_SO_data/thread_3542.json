    "body" : "<p>(Java, Eclipse) I have a variable instance on which I call a method (like o.setValue(...) ) in between this and the output, something, somewhere (in the very complex legacy codebase with custom Annotations &amp; Bindings and Reflection) calls the .setValue() method from some superclass.</p>\n<pre><code>var i = ...;\ni.setValue(true); //setValue() Inherited from some superclass\ni.getValue()==true\n[Framework / Reflection / Annotation magic]\ni.getValue()!=true; //where was setValue() called on my instance?\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to find out where. Thus, I want to set a conditional breakpoint (in Eclipse, Java) that tiggers exactly if my Instances setValue() method is called. How can I do that?</p>\n<p>I did try a conditional Breakpoint, but the condition is evaluated in the scope of .setValue(), and my instance usually doesn't have any special properties, because it's before a complex change or the values are too general (null or true etc.).</p>\n<p>The easiest/ most elegant/ general way would be via its address, but that value is in a different scope/Module.</p>\n<p>Thus, how would I get my instance address into the Breakpoint condition, and accessible in all Modules/scopes.</p>\n",

    "body" : "I was generealising - It&#39;s something that happend to me several times. One case was a Jbutton (which I could solve via label-text), the other case was a JavaFX  table-cell that didn&#39;t have a value (yet, but will soon), whose pseudo-class was over overwritten (I now realize, I could have added a new pseudoclass to identify).  The reason I don&#39;t want a value-based method is because usually, the values are too common (null or true...) or its before a complex change (which will change these values).  An address based way would be easier (and appeal to my sense of elegance).",
