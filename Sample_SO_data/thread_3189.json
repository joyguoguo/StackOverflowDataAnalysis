    "body" : "<p>My Java microservice is using the AWS SDK for Java v2.21.</p>\n<p>I construct an EC2 Client in this way:</p>\n<pre><code>Ec2Client.builder().credentialsProvider(DefaultCredentialsProvider.create())\n        .endpointOverride(URI.create(&quot;http://localhost:6080/mypath&quot;))\n        .build();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I execute a DescribeTagsRequest against the constructed Ec2Client and this results in a POST to http://localhost:6080 to path &quot;/mypath&quot;</p>\n<p>When I upgrade to v2.25 of the SDK the path is now being stripped and the path of the POST to http://localhost:6080 is &quot;/&quot; rather than &quot;/mypath&quot;</p>\n<p>What has changed from v2.21 to v2.25 and how can I mitigate this behaviour so that the path is used as before?</p>\n",
