    "body" : "<p>I've the necessity to write a TCP subscriber and a TCP publisher and I was thinking about using Apache Camel Netty for it.</p>\n<p>The workflow of the subscriber is the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The subscriber connects to the server and sends a command to it</li>\n<li>The server replies with OK or NOK</li>\n<li>If the answer is OK, the subscriber can then start to receive/pull data</li>\n<li>If the answer is NOK, the subscriber should send another command and retry the workflow</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The workflow of the publisher is symmetric to the previous one and that's:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The publisher listens for an incoming connection (only one)</li>\n<li>The client sends a command</li>\n<li>If the command is invalid (not readable), the publisher must close the connection with the client and wait for the next incoming connection</li>\n<li>If the command is valid, the publisher replies with OK (it can ignore the command)</li>\n<li>The publisher starts to send data to the connected client</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Moreover, in case of an error, in the workflow of the subscriber, the subscriber should connect to the next available server in a round-robin fashion.</p>\n<p>I've read the documentation extensively, but I fail to find a way to implement these 2 workflows.</p>\n<p>Can somebody please help?</p>\n",
