    "body" : "<p>This seems to be a bug in the Appwrite library (also in the newest version at the time of writing, 8.1.0).</p>\n<p>It was written in Kotlin where the Compiler automatically generates getter and setter functions to enable Java code to access properties. The problem here is with the <code>endpoint</code> property: The auto-generated <code>setEndpoint(String)</code> function conflicts with an already existing <code>setEndpoint(String)</code> function that the developers explicitly added to the class, so you have two versions here, hence the ambiguity.</p>\n<p>Looking at the Kotlin code it seems that this <code>endpoint</code> property shouldn't be public in the first place (at least not the setter). Making it private would prevent the Compiler generating the conflicting function and everything should work.</p>\n<p>But that is nothing you can do (except writing a bug report to the developers). If you do not want to switch with your code to Kotlin as well (there this works without issues because you don't need the Java-interop code), then one possible workaround would be to pass the endpoint to the constructor instead of setting it after the object was instantiated:</p>\n<pre><code>Client client = new Client(context.getApplicationContext(), &quot;https://example&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then you don't need to call the ambiguous <code>setEndpoint</code> function anymore.</p>\n",
