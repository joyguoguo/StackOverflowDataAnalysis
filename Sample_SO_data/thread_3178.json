    "title" : "How to get a filepath from a unix system using java where the path is {{parameters.secret-path}}/file",
    "body" : "<p>Currently there is a unix-based system that exposes a file in what the team is saying would be {{parameters.secret-path}}/file.  I am not sure how to read that in java given the enclosing of double curly braces and not sure what that means.  I have tried using the NIO library and trying to get <code>Path.of(System.getenv(&quot;parameters.secret-path&quot;), &quot;file.txt&quot;).toString();</code> and also tried <code>Path.of(System.getProperty(&quot;parameters.secret-path&quot;), &quot;file.txt&quot;).toString(); </code> but each time it is coming as null and unable to find that path.  I'm not entirely familiar with the double curly braces what that looks like in a unix-like system, so I'm sure there could be something I'm missing.  Let know if anyone has any suggestions on properly finding this path as it isn't a root path.</p>\n<p>The goal is to be able to find some ssl cert paths as String to properly build SSL properties for a java sql connection for a postgresql db.</p>\n",
