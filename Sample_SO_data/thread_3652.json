    "title" : "Webflux Connection interrupted on the server due to client timeout",
    "body" : "<p>I have an application using WebFlux that processes a large amount (~500 TPS) of transactional information. The application runs two services: when the first service succeeds, it triggers a call to the second one. However, the second service, which uses reactive programming and runs on Netty, can be slow in some cases. To provide a quick response to the client, we have set a 2-second timeout on the requesting application, and the client checks the result through another service.</p>\n<p>The problem is that when a timeout occurs, the second service stops execution without completing, even though it handles transactional information. Is it possible to ensure that the request is not interrupted if the client has a short timeout?</p>\n",
