    "body" : "<p>I am currently working in network with nodes and paths in AnyLogic. In between these nodes vehicle agents are driving around picking up  guests, which is also agent based. As soon as a vehicle &quot;picks up a guest&quot; I would like to change the color of the guest or make the guest invisible or something similar, basically that in the representation it can be seen that customers are not moving parallel to the vehicle in the representation but together. My idea was to change the color via code after pick up but it does not necessarily need to be this way.</p>\n<p>Thanks for helping.</p>\n",
