    "title" : "Has anyone developed a method to set the size of the first form in a codename one/javase app being built for Windows Desktop?",
    "body" : "<p>I have started testing my code on both macOS and Windows Desktops before I build for the iPad. The macOS build opens at almost iPad Mini size and everything in the app is useable. When the build opens on Windows Desktop, the screen is approximately 3.5&quot; x 4&quot; in size. Though I can immediately resize the form when the app opens, the PreferredSize has been stored, and when I get to the form where the user designs exercises and plays, my ScaleImageLabels are two-thirds the size of the macOS build, and the iPad Mini Simulator screen I develop on, which makes the small SILs used in the design hard to drag and drop.</p>\n<p>Even thought setPreferredSize for a form is not recommended, I need the form to open at approximately 5&quot; x 7&quot; so the small SILs are draggable. Because of the different resolutions of monitors, I would only set the minimum size of form 1 to make sure the SILs are large enough drag when the user gets to that phase in the app.</p>\n<p>I thought of running a method such as:</p>\n<pre><code>if (Windows.Desktop) {\n    form.setPreferredSize(350, 550);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>but I cannot find a search statement in Google that leads me to any useable information. I have found the ways to Style the components in the theme, but I have to set an acceptable size for the first form.</p>\n<p>Thanks for any ideas.</p>\n<p>Edit 1\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nvozQiPN.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nvozQiPN.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>The TLAssistStub sets the AppWidth at 800, Height at 600, but the app opens at 3 5/8&quot; x 3&quot;. Below is the app opening size with the TLAssistStub on Windows 11, Parallels, MovebyDrag.class, showing smaller players and the ball a dot in front of 9, and the same code building macOS Desktop app opening on 16&quot; MacBook Pro, full screen capture, MovebyDrag.class, showing iPad Mini-size players and the ball drawn at a useable size.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5LqaLeHO.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5LqaLeHO.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\nI will rebuild with FullScreen = true, but I am trying to open the app at 5&quot; x 7&quot; and grow from there.</p>\n",

The glass pane and content pane grids are the correct size on the size-adjusted form, but the SILs on the both panes are 66% the size of those on the same screen in the macOS build.</p>\n",

Assigning the UIID yesterday to those labels I previously missed corrected this.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>1 container I added a Styled label and Styled button to clipped the top and bottom of the text. The size of the container grew when the JFrame was resized, but the PreferredSize of the area in the container where the text is assigned did not grow. I will work on that container today and report back.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After what I identified yesterday and discussed on Github, I can Style around everything but PreferredSize, and if the Windows (or Desktop) API only allowed me to set the size of the JFrame for the initial form, I could adjust that starting point for PreferredSize and I think everything would fall into a useable place. As I noted in my report from yesterday afternoon, I think a starting size of 1280 x 1080 would work for both platforms.</p>\n",
