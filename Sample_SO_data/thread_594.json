    "title" : "Weird behavior when a java application perform name resolution in windows server",
    "body" : "<p>I'm troubleshooting a java web application that is running on windows 2025 machine joined to an AD.</p>\n<p>Using the host file in serverA, i try to re-direct the http traffic meant for serverB to itself(serverA) like so:</p>\n<pre><code>10.0.0.1 serverB\n</code></pre>\n<p>there is no entry for serverA in the host file since it is already relying on the dns server.</p>\n<p>However i found out that the application has identified itself as serverB instead of serverA in the app logs and in the app configuration itself. why the beahvior is like this?\nWhy the app assume itself as serverB when it should know itself as serverA? is this an universal name resolution logic or only specific to this java app?\nWhat is more baffling is that it is as if the app somehow performed a reverse lookup where it lookup by ip first instead of name</p>\n",
