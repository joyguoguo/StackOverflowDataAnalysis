    "body" : "<p>I've just installed <code>Ghidra</code> and tried to debug a sample program to get a taste of it. I've installed Python 3.12 and the redistributed site-packages with it (from <code>\\Ghidra\\Debug\\Debugger-agent-dbgeng\\pypkg\\dist</code>). So far, everything is OK. However, when I launch the executable with <code>dbgeng</code>, it says <code>boolean com.google.protobuf.GeneratedMessageV3.isStringEmpty(java.lang.Object)</code> on the Debug Console, and fails. I have done a little bit of search on the internet. Some say it is due to an old version of <code>protobuf</code> (it is very likely), and I am not a Java guy. So, I don't know how to install the new version of the library.</p>\n",

Apparently, the extension comes with an older version of <code>protobuf-java</code> library, specifically the version <code>3.17.3</code>, and the Ghidra loads this version, not the newer version <code>3.21.8</code> that comes bundled with it.</p>\n",
