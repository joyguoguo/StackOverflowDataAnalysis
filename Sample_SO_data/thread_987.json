But MI does support <a href=\"https://mi.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/observe-and-manage/classic-observability-traces/monitoring-with-opentelemetry-mi/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OTLP</a>, and there is a <a href=\"https://docs.sentry.io/concepts/otlp/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">beta</a> for sentry to work with that protocol, but it seems very limited right now. I&#39;ve tried to do a quick setup but it&#39;s just too much work for a question",
