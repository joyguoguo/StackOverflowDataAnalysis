Please correct me if I'm wrong but the primary goal is to segment domains (business logic) into separated independent services that are still wrapped by an overarching build orchestrator.</p>\n<p>From my perspective, even though the domains are separated and independent, that doesn't necessarily mean that each domain should control an independent persistent layer, instead they should share a persistent layer to share referential integrity and maintain easy querying.</p>\n<p><em><strong>This leads me to my primary questions</strong></em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there are multiple independent services that are all making transactions to the db, how do you ensure that if there is a failure in a downstream process, how do you properly manage the rollback of the previous transactions? Do you just literally chain try catches from the start all the way to the end to ensure that the lowest process is successful? In both these two other posts, people point out 2 phase commit protocol. Is this still used/relevant (I ask because the posts are rather old)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18662025/in-service-oriented-architecture-soa-should-each-service-own-its-own-data\">Data Management in SOA</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10187360/transaction-management-in-soa\">Transaction Management in SOA</a></p>\n",
