    "title" : "Why does Maven multi-module project resolve dependencies based on Nexus, but builds based on local files?",
    "body" : "<p>I have a pretty basic multi-module project. The parent is aware of the two modules, the two modules are aware of the parent and <code>module2</code> includes <code>module1</code> as dependency as well. So far everything works as expected, the application runs etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>parent\n<ul>\n<li>module1</li>\n<li>module2</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I needed to update a dependency in <code>module1</code> and when using <code>mvn dependency:tree</code>, I see the updated dependency. Though, when I do the same for <code>module2</code>, it still shows the outdated dependency as a transient dependency of <code>module1</code>. From my understanding, the reason is that I have an outdated snapshot of <code>module1</code> in Nexus and my local <code>.m2</code> directory, whichever of both might be taken into account.</p>\n<p>The result of this is that <code>module2</code> starts successfully, but at runtime fails at some point, because a method is called on the dependency of <code>module1</code> which, doesn't exist in the older version, but only the newer one. But still, the <code>module1</code> is correctly build with the newer version of the dependency, <code>module2</code> seems to link against <code>module1</code> of the multi-module project, but starts with a classpath containing an outdated dependency of <code>module1</code>, breaking at runtime in the end.</p>\n<pre><code>The following method did not exist:\n\n    'java.lang.Object org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils.getIfNull(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)'\n[...]\nThe called method's class, org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils, is available from the following locations:\n\n    jar:file:/C:/Users/THS/.m2/repository/org/apache/commons/commons-lang3/3.17.0/commons-lang3-3.17.0.jar!/org/apache/commons/lang3/ObjectUtils.class\n\nThe called method's class hierarchy was loaded from the following locations:\n\n    org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils: file:/C:/Users/THS/.m2/repository/org/apache/commons/commons-lang3/3.17.0/commons-lang3-3.17.0.jar\n</code></pre>\n<p>This looks like a runtime classpath issue to me, because the outdated version of <code>module1</code> in Nexus or <code>.m2</code> not only has an outdated dependency, but the classes of the <code>module1</code> were renamed as well. But those are properly used by <code>module2</code>. <code>module2</code> isn't able at all to work with the outdated version of <code>module1</code> in Nexus and <code>.m2</code>, there is a strong coupling, class names would be different etc. Things couldn't even start at all...</p>\n<p><strong>Why is that snapshot taken into account when resolving dependencies and creating the runtime classpath instead of what is contained in the multi-module project only?</strong></p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>Seem to have been on the wrong track with Nexus and <code>.m2</code>, the problem still happened when deleting the outdated snapshots everyhwere. The real root cause was that the parent project made Spring Boot available, that included <code>commons-lang3</code> already, but in an outdated version. Explicit versions in <code>module1</code> simply didn't override things in the context of <code>module2</code> anymore, something liek the following in the püarent or <code>module2</code> was needed instead.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;\n    &lt;dependencies&gt;\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.commons&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;commons-lang3&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;${commons-lang3.version}&lt;/version&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n    &lt;/dependencies&gt;\n&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;\n</code></pre>\n",
