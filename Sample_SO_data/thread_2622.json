    "body" : "<p>The point of class diagrams is to show how types link together.</p>\n<p>Thus, the <em>whole point</em> is to show how your take on the concept &quot;Parking Lots&quot; (I'm assuming your <code>List&lt;Car&gt; carList;</code> line is a field in <code>class ParkingLot</code> for the purposes of this explanation) are linked to your take on the concept of &quot;Cars&quot;.</p>\n<p>There's intentionally no option to say: &quot;I leave it to the reader&quot;. Everything is meant to be defined in rigid, absolute terms - not the wishywishy 'who really knows what it means' of the english language. With one exception: Certain types are elevated as 'well, everybody does know what they mean / the language specification itself locks down in stone what they mean', and <em>those</em> are the ones you can use here - <code>String</code>, int, double, boolean, etc - that's where that list is coming from.</p>\n<p>Car is not on that list.</p>\n<p>Thus, what you have to do here is completely different from indicating &quot;there is a carList, it is an attribute&quot;. You have no attribute at all. Instead, you show there is a 1..N relationship between cars and parking lots. Car is a 'box' in your diagram. ParkingLot is also a box. A line exists between the box, and a property of the line is that the 'Car' side has quantity nature 'N', and 'ParkingLot' has quantity nature '0..1' (or '1*' or any other way to express: a car may or may not be on a parking lot.. but it definitely cannot be simultaneously parked in two lots!)</p>\n<p>This style of diagramming isn't programming. The point is to show in a quick to understand visual way how your various types relate to one another.</p>\n<p>Having 2 out of every 4 boxes all draw a line to a box named 'String' is not going to make things visually clear at all, so you don't do that. But just having your field definition code in a little box, with boxes haphazardly scattered around a white canvas all on their own, <em>also</em> is completely pointless. Showing that ParkingLot is a thing, Car is a thing, and 'parking lots have many cars, though it could have 0', but a car can only ever be on at most one lot - <em>that is the point</em>.</p>\n<p>If for the thing you're doing this doesn't sound useful then don't make a diagram at all.</p>\n",
