    "body" : "<p>I am trying to make an app for android, just a small little &quot;Hello World&quot; app to assess how it all works. I have tried on numerous occasions to get gradle to wrap the app but I just keep running into error after error after failed attempt... This is more or less the procedure that I have used on 3+ occasions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>I install android studio, jdk 17, and gradle (default install ver. 4 had to remove and wget the .deb for v8)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>point JAVA_HOME:</p>\n<p>export JAVA_HOME=/PATH/TO/JAVA</p>\n<p>export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>make my basic app structure and starting code and verified with ai</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>thought gradle wrapper needed to run in project root, then learned that it needs to run in the main folder. ran gradle wrapper in .../app/src/main/</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>chmod +x gradlew</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>and then ./gradlew assembleDebug</p>\n<p>At this point, either only default tasks are available (or a short list with nothing helpful) or a longer list that does not include assembleDebug and even when I just try to do ./gradlew build, the build fails immediately. I removed any scrap of JDK or gradle from my system so if anyone can tell me maybe where i am going wrong here I would appreciate it</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
