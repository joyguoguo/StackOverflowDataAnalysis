I expected the OTP to be correctly entered into the input field for verification after it was sent. However, instead, the OTP was not entered into the field, causing the test to fail.</p>\n",

You should think about bypassing the OTP verification by using stubs or talking to the developer to provide an OTP code that can be used every time to verify it. Another option may be to fetch an OTP Code from the database for the test environment instead.",
