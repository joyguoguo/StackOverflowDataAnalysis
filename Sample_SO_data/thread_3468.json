So here i am again\nThis is a the apk:\n<a href=\"http://47.106.109.236:8010/mms/ble-tag-english-app-release-v3.1.37.apk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://47.106.109.236:8010/mms/ble-tag-english-app-release-v3.1.37.apk</a>\nMy reverse engineering is long time ago\nI decompiled it with diffrent tools\nbut am blind to find the transfer section...\nSo <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XWApNAQc.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this device</a> (2.1&quot; B/W) works with BLE,\nOn the website <a href=\"http://47.106.109.236:8082\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://47.106.109.236:8082</a>\nyou can create templates.\nFor example just one big word or a QR.\nThis does not work for me. It does appear on the app\nbut there is no way to apply the new template.\nI know from other devices there is no much code\nneeded to send a byte array to make a picture\nvisible on the ESL.\n(I have only used Android/BLE for remote control\nof toys or audio transmission)\nI'm sure you know how to do this.\nOther forums always tell me: ask on stackoverflow!\nMaybe you can give me a hint were to start.</p>\n",
