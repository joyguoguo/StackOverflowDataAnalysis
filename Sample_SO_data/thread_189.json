    "body" : "<p>I am new to <strong>Java</strong> and starting with <strong>Spring Boot</strong> development. I prefer using lightweight <strong>code editors</strong> like <strong>Zed</strong>, <strong>Lite-XL</strong> and <strong>Helix</strong>  and want to avoid the high resource usage and complexity of full IDEs (Eclipse, IntelliJ).</p>\n<p>The official Spring Tools are available for VS Code and Eclipse, which I am trying to bypass.</p>\n<p>I am looking for advice on the best minimalist setup</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Zed :</strong> Is there a feasible way to achieve productive Spring Boot development (e.g., smart code completion, debugging) directly within a editor like <strong>Zed</strong> (Are there specific extensions, Language Server Protocol (LSP) configurations, or workarounds?)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Minimalist IDE Alternative:</strong> If a full IDE is unavoidable, what is the most <strong>resource-light</strong> and <strong>quick-to-setup</strong> alternative for a Spring Boot project is <strong>neovim</strong> good or it ?, if yes how can i set it up i don't have good experience with vim but i can use <strong>helix</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Core Tooling:</strong> What are the <strong>essential command-line tools</strong> and scripts (Maven/Gradle commands) needed to run and manage a Spring Boot project entirely outside of an IDE?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any tips for a new Java developer who values speed and a minimalist GUI workflow would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n",
