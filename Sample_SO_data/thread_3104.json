It's all or nothing: In uncooked mode, you can move the cursor where-ever you want it to be, add colours, overwrite characters, get each character typed immediately on <code>System.in</code> (instead of the whole line at once when the user pressed enter) and so on.</p>\n<p>You don't want it because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It's very very complicated, for example, pressing enter no longer moves the cursor back but it does, if you don't intercept it, 'scroll one down'. So you get this:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>Username: Bukakiewicz\n                     Age: 20\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which you can fix by injecting positioning, but, complicated.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p>Java doesn't actually have baked in libraries to make this feasible; instead, you need to figure out what kind of terminal you are running on and send the right terminal code symbols which depends a bit on your OS and other factors. This is many weeks of work and requires having all sorts of computers available to you. It goes against the thing java tries to do: Write it once, it runs more or less the same way pretty much everywhere. You can fix that with an external dependency, though.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Most IDEs have baked in little terminal-esque things to run your app in, and a lot of these don't support this <em>at all</em>, so that means you can no longer debug your app inside your IDE and this complicates matters further.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you really want all this the best strategy by far is to use a library that does a lot of the work for you, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lanterna</a>.</p>\n<p>But know that, if you all you wanted was to 'avoid' the newline entered by the user, that really is shooting down a mosquito with a bazooka.</p>\n",
