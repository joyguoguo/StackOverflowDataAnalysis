    "title" : "How to make my block (extending to BaseEntityBlock) face to the player when placed?",
    "body" : "<p>The thing is, I already know how to make a simple block having a single texture on every side, but what i want is a block, like a furnace, which has a front, a top, 3 sides, and a bottom. however, i have no idea if there is a blockstate method to do this.</p>\n<p>At First I used blockbench to get a json file for a block model which had different textueres on each side of the block, which is perfect. Afterwards I watched a tutorial where somebody rotated the block which had its own class like e.g. &quot;EnchantingTableBlock&quot; which extended to the class HorizontalDirectionalBlock, but this can't work since my block already has its own class which extends to BaseEntityBlock, and since i can't extend to multiple classes, I have no idea what to do.</p>\n<p>The block i am talking about is my ForgeBlock.\nThe block is actually a BlockEntity, so the block also has a ForgeBlockEntity class, but i assume it's irrelevant to my problem. This is the complete class:</p>\n<pre><code>public class ForgeBlock extends BaseEntityBlock {\n    public static final MapCodec&lt;ForgeBlock&gt; CODEC = simpleCodec(ForgeBlock::new);\n\n    public ForgeBlock(Properties pProperties) {\n        super(pProperties);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected MapCodec&lt;? extends BaseEntityBlock&gt; codec() {\n        return CODEC;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public @Nullable BlockEntity newBlockEntity(BlockPos pPos, BlockState pState) {\n        return new ForgeBlockEntity(pPos, pState);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected RenderShape getRenderShape(BlockState pState) {\n        return RenderShape.MODEL;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onRemove(BlockState pState, Level pLevel, BlockPos pPos, BlockState pNewState, boolean pIsMoving) {\n        if (pState.getBlock() != pNewState.getBlock()) {\n            BlockEntity blockEntity = pLevel.getBlockEntity(pPos);\n            if (blockEntity instanceof ForgeBlockEntity forge) {\n                forge.drops();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected ItemInteractionResult useItemOn(ItemStack pStack, BlockState pState, Level pLevel, BlockPos pPos, Player pPlayer, InteractionHand pHand, BlockHitResult pHitResult) {\n        if (!pLevel.isClientSide) {\n            BlockEntity entity = pLevel.getBlockEntity(pPos);\n            if (entity instanceof ForgeBlockEntity forge) {\n                ((ServerPlayer) pPlayer).openMenu(new SimpleMenuProvider(forge, Component.literal(&quot;Forge&quot;)), pPos);\n            } else {\n                throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Our Container provider is missing!&quot;);\n            }\n        }\n        return ItemInteractionResult.sidedSuccess(pLevel.isClientSide);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    @Nullable\n    public &lt;T extends BlockEntity&gt; BlockEntityTicker&lt;T&gt; getTicker(Level pLevel, BlockState pState, BlockEntityType&lt;T&gt; pBlockEntityType) {\n        if (pLevel.isClientSide) {\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        return createTickerHelper(pBlockEntityType, ModBlockEntities.FORGE_BE.get(),\n                (level, blockPos, blockState, forge) -&gt; forge.tick(level, blockPos, blockState));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n",
