    "title" : "SpringToolSuite Database Connectivity Tool won&#39;t add Drivers",
    "body" : "<p>I have the latest Spring Tool Suite (STS) 4.32.0 and 4.32.1.  In both cases, I did manage to add the JBoss Tools to both versions.   I have a basic SpringBoot starter project, and I have the Oracle Drivers, and the Spring Data JPA libraries in my maven pom.xml.     I can absolutely access this database and it's tables from this app, that is not the question.  I am working on a project where there is already an existing Entity and Repository layer which also 100% works and talks to the Dev Oracle database.</p>\n<p>However, the entities need LOTS and LOTS of work.   I want to start a new project where I reverse engineer the entities from the database rather than having to do the work manually.  Manually would take forever, and I would rather shortcut the process.</p>\n<p>So, using the STS Database Connectivity to reverse engineer is something I'd like to do, BUT, unfortunately STS is not agreeing with me.   Whenever I try to add the new Driver Definition, it won't let me add any JARS at all, they are ALL greyed out.   I know in my .m2/repository/com/oracle/jdbc I have drivers for ojdbc8 and ojdbc11, but I cannot for the life of me get Eclipse to let me add any drivers at all.</p>\n<p>I seem to remember years back I had to add the Oracle or MySQL or PostgreSQL drivers to Eclipse itself so I would see something than the only H2 driver, but I can't find that now on the Internet.    If I had to copy drivers into Eclipse, I would.</p>\n<p>I cannot use IntelliJ at all, and I know there are other basic Hibernate tools, but I don't want to create a new project to just do a reverse engineering.   That's really my last resolution short of hand coding tables myself.   I just want to see what the Hibernate Tools determine to be a reasonable entity.</p>\n<p>So, if there is either another tool to reverse engineer entities, or somewhat I can fix the STS Database Connectivity for their DataSource Explorer, that would be great.</p>\n",
