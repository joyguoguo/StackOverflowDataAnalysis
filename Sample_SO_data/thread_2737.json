    "body" : "<p>My application works this way: a customer calls a certain DID, Twilio launches the webhook to my app, and then my app connects the customer to a specific manager. The manager has to press &quot;1&quot; to accept the call and to start a conversation to the customer. This is achieved by using  verb:</p>\n<pre><code>        var gather = new Gather.Builder()\n                .action(ACCEPTED_CALL_PATH)\n                .numDigits(1)\n                .inputs(Gather.Input.DTMF)\n                .timeout(10);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The route stated in ACCEPTED_CALL_PATH checks that &quot;1&quot; was pressed. After this, I want to start a conference and add the manager to it, so that the calls to third parties can be made later. How this can be achieved?</p>\n",
