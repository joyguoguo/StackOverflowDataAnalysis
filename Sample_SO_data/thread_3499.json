As you can see, it contains two squares which do not overlap and are also not adjacent.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>(0, 0)\n(0, 5)\n(5, 5)\n(5, 0)\n(0, 0)\n\n(12, 12)\n(12, 17)\n(17, 17)\n(17, 12)\n(12, 12)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now how do I get polygons from a list of coordinates? Of course, I could traverse all coordinates manually and check if they are a <em>closed ring</em>, but is there a more elegant way?</p>\n<p>I've tried to look at the methods of <code>GeometryFactory</code> and <code>Geometry</code>, but I couldn't find anything similar to what I'm trying to achieve.</p>\n<p>Note: one may assume that the received coordinates always represent a sequence of polygons <strong>without holes</strong>.</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>In JTS, a <a href=\"https://locationtech.github.io/jts/javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/Polygon.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Polygon</a> consists of an outer shell and inner holes. Both are represented as LinearRings.</p>\n<p>Depending on the situation, you could represent those coordinates using different geometries (e.g., two Polygons, a MultiPolygon, or a GeometryCollection).</p>\n<p>From the two lists of coordinates, which in your case make up a closed LinearRings (that's good, <a href=\"https://locationtech.github.io/jts/javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/LinearRing.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">we need that!</a>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A <code>LinearRing</code> is a <a href=\"https://locationtech.github.io/jts/javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/LineString.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"class in org.locationtech.jts.geom\"><code>LineString</code></a> which is both closed and simple. In other words, the first and last coordinate in the ring must be equal, and the ring must not self-intersect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With the GeometryFactory, you were on the right track. There is the method <code>geometryFactory.createPolygon(coordinates),</code> that you could use to construct the polygons, but first, you would need to build each JTS Coordinate <code>var c = new Coordinate(x, y)</code>.</p>\n",
