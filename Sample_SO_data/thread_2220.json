    "body" : "<p>This is a Java project using Eclipse and GitHub archiving -- has been running for several years.</p>\n<p>Something weird happened with Eclipse (MacOS).  I went to Search the workspace for a text string &quot;initWireframes&quot;, and the software responded by changing the project's Node folder from &quot;DataflowGeometry&quot; --&gt; &quot;initWireframes/DataflowGeometry&quot;.</p>\n<p>I could not undo.  I've re-imported the project from GitHub, and everything is back EXCEPT: I cannot get modified .java files into &quot;Stages Changes&quot; during the Commit setup.  Instead, eGit is placing them in &quot;Unstaged Changes&quot; and refuses my commands to move them into &quot;Stages Changes&quot;</p>\n<p>Can anyone tell me how to repair this?</p>\n<p>I explained that above</p>\n",
