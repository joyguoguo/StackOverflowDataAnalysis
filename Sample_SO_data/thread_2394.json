    "title" : "How can I make Intellij links the source code of a library in my running microservice, like Eclipse?",
    "body" : "<p>I have got the source code of a library. Using maven I can <code>mvn install</code> it, it generates a one snapshot jar version in my local m2 repository. And then I have a microservice which uses that library in the POM. Everything works.</p>\n<p>In my Eclipse, I can have those two <em>projects</em> opened at the same time, one for the library and the other for the microservice.</p>\n<p>With Eclipse, making a change in the source code of the library, without making a full <code>mvn install</code>, just with Automatic Build, it will reflect changes to a microservice when it is running (well, I have got to stop and rerun the microservice) and can see the source code of the library and debug it easily.</p>\n<p>In Intellij, I can have two windows on those components (library and microservice that uses it), and from the microservice I can decompile the class and see the decompiled source code. But after making changes in the library, I have to do a <code>mvn install</code> of it, so the microservice will reflect the changes.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to make changes in the library that updates a microservice when it is running?</p>\n<p>Adding the source folder of the library into the microservice into the modules settings didn't work. Neither pressing the Build button in the library project.</p>\n",

    "body" : "I solved it , thanks to an answer someone wrote here, that right now I dont see. I am confused with SOverlfow, honestly. They sugested to add modules. In my case, I went to File-&gt;Project Structure, Project Settings-&gt; Modules. I added with the &#39;+&#39; the folder of my lib. I believe it asked me to &quot;existing source&quot; or &#39;existing module&#39;. And to use Maven project. Now I have two folder in my Intellij windows. Making changes in the lib, they are reflected in the execution of the main microservice. Thanks a lot to everybody!",
