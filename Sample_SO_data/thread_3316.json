    "title" : "How do I control the placement of shapes in a Group in JavaFX?",
    "body" : "<p>I want to add buttons to my app, and I want the buttons to show multiple shapes. These shapes could be ellipses, polygons, or other shapes. And I want to repeat them in some of the buttons. So, for example, I might want to show three identical polygons, side by side, in a Button. I've instantiated the polygon with all its points. As far as I can tell, I need to put them in a Group, and add that Group to my Button. But I don't see a way to specify the position of the polygons in the group.</p>\n<p>Of course, I could create three identical polygons with different coordinates, but they're all the same shape in different positions. I would really like to place the first one, then translate the next two horizontally before placing them. But I don't see a method to translate a shape, either in the <code>Shape</code> class, the <code>Polygon</code> class, or the <code>Group</code> class.</p>\n<p>I also considered using the Canvas class. The Canvas can give me a GraphicsContext, which has a <code>translate()</code> method. But unfortunately, it doesn't have a method that takes my Polygon. Instead, it has a <code>strokePolygon()</code> method that takes a set of points. Unfortunately, <code>Polygon</code> is just one of the shapes I might be drawing. It might also be an <code>Ellipse</code>, or something else. And canvas doesn't have a method to draw whatever Shape I've instantiated, like <code>strokeShape(Shape shape)</code>. Without this method, my code starts to get really complicated.</p>\n<p>So in a nutshell, The Group and the Canvas each have a different problem. The Group will draw a generic shape of any class, but I don't see a way to translate them to draw multiple copies. The Canvas will let me do the translations, but I need to call different methods for different shapes. They're both clumsy ways to write the code. Of course, there are plenty of ways to draw these shapes, but I need them to show on a Button, so it has to be on something that I can pass to the Button constructor: <code>Button(String text, Node graphic)</code>. Is there a cleaner way to do this? Is there something I'm missing?</p>\n",
