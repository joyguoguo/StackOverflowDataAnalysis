    "title" : "Should consumers reading different topics in the same application belong to the same consumer group?",
    "body" : "<p>I'm working on a Kafka-based Spring Boot application that reads from two Kafka topics: topicA and topicB. These topics carry completely unrelated data and are handled by different services within the same application.</p>\n<p>A colleague insists that since both consumers live in the same application, they should belong to the same consumer group,  because &quot;one application = one consumer group&quot;.</p>\n<p>However, I believe this is misleading. As far as I understand, a consumer group is used to distribute partitions of the same topic across multiple consumers, primarily for horizontal scaling.</p>\n<p>In my case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>One consumer subscribes to one topicA, another - to multiple (topicGroupB)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The topics are unrelated and are not meant to be processed together.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The consumers are logically independent — they have different deserializers, business logic, and processing requirements.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main disadvantage i see using the same group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>If one consumer fails, Kafka rebalances the entire group, causing unnecessary pause in the other consumer. - though, i'm not sure how much trouble it causes in real live.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There's no partition sharing between the two consumers anyway — they each read different topics.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is there any <strong>benefit</strong> in having two unrelated consumers (reading different topics) in the same consumer group, just because they live in the same application?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Are there any best practices or official recommendations (e.g., from Confluent or Apache Kafka) regarding this pattern?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>P.S. it's Kafka, not Kafka streams</p>\n",
