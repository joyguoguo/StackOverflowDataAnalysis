    "body" : "<p>I am trying to get a Maven build to work properly. I am on a VM workstation that has a jdk15 install.</p>\n<p>I can only add files to my user directory.</p>\n<p>The mule-app-maven-plugin-1.1.pom has a few issues that I have to resolve. I already set up mirrors in the .m2\\settings.xml to deal with the HTTP repositories, but I've gotten stuck on the tools.jar.</p>\n<p>The dependency in the POM is:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.sun&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;tools&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;${java.version}&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;scope&gt;system&lt;/scope&gt;\n    &lt;systemPath&gt;${java.home}/../lib/tools.jar&lt;/systemPath&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I can snag a tools.jar and put it in my user directory, but I need to tell Maven to look there instead of the location coded into the mule-app-maven-plugin-1.1.pom. Is there something I can do in the settings.xml (or something else) to redirect this search to the location where I actually can drop a tools.jar?</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>What you are trying to do will not work with any JDK release newer than JDK 8 since the tools.jar file was <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69353634/tools-jar-does-not-come-with-jdk-installation\">removed in JDK 9</a>. That may mean that <code>mule-app-maven-plugin</code> is not compatible with JDK 9 or greater. It would make also sense that it was never tested with newer JDKs since it is compatible with Mule 3.x only, which was compatible up to JDK 8 with its later releases. It may not work correctly with JDKs greater than JDK 8.</p>\n<p>Also it is not recommended to JDK 15 for anything else at all since it was a short lived release. As a non-LTS version it was supported for six months until March 2021. Not even Mule 4.x versions claim to support non-LTS JDKs.</p>\n<p>Conclusion: use the version of the JDK that the version of the <code>mule-app-maven-plugin</code> expects. Since it has been retired since 2019 there doesn't seem to be documentation available. I recomend to use the same version of the JDK that your version of Mule 3.x supports.</p>\n<p>Update: the replacement for <code>mule-app-maven-plugin</code> is <code>mule-maven-plugin</code>. There are different versions for Mule 3.x and Mule 4.x. <a href=\"https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/3.9/mule-maven-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mule Maven Plugin 2.3.x</a> was the last branch to support Mule 3.x. Now it is EOL as all versions of Mule 3.x. For Mule 4.x there are <a href=\"https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/latest/mmp-concept\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">newer versions</a>. The recommendation is to use the latest version released that is compatible with your Mule runtime version. You can find them in the <a href=\"https://docs.mulesoft.com/release-notes/mule-maven-plugin/mule-maven-plugin-release-notes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: always use a JDK compatible with Mule and the respective Maven plugin. These products are only compatible with some JDKs (see requirements in the documentation and release notes) and were <strong>not tested</strong> with Non-LTS JDKs. Also the older Maven plugins may not work correctly with newer versions of Maven.</p>\n",
