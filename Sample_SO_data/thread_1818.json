    "body" : "<p>The only objectively correct answer to your question is &quot;because the spec (the Java Language Specification) says so&quot;.</p>\n<p>I'm assuming that's not a satisfying answer. However, know that therefore the rest of this answer is somewhat subjective. It's trying to answer why the language is designed this way.</p>\n<p>Note, first, that your question has an error in it. What you meant to write is this:</p>\n<pre><code>class Child&lt;T&gt; extends Base&lt;T&gt; {\n  // keeps it generic\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Raw types</h2>\n<p>Java 1.0-1.4 didn't have any generics. Java strongly prefers allowing code written at java version X to compile and run on Y (where Y is higher than X). If that's not the case, say, if java 1.5 which introduced generics means all code written in java 1.4 or below simply fails to compile, then, is it really java 1.5, or is it more fair to call it qava 1.0 - i.e. a completely new language at that point?</p>\n<p>The way generics was added to the language, and the way to ensure pre-generics code compiles and runs on post-generics java versions, is the concept <strong>Raw types</strong>.</p>\n<p>Just <code>List</code> is a raw type. If you try to use it, it works, but the compiler throws in the towel and will no longer ensure type safety for you. This compiles and runs, and because it's not actually valid, ends up throwing a ClassCastException even though there is no cast in this code:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\nlist.add(&quot;Hello&quot;);\nList raw = list;\nList&lt;Number&gt; numbers = raw;\nSystem.out.println(numbers.get(0).intValue()); //CCEx here\n</code></pre>\n<p>The CCEx is fair enough - your string (<code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code>) isn't a number, and doesn't have an <code>intValue()</code> method.</p>\n<p>But, you could write the above code in java 1.4 just the same (remove <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> and everything in between them), and it would compile and run.. and throw the same ClassCastException (that is, if you add a cast to <code>Number</code> to <code>numbers.get(0)</code>, of course).</p>\n<p><strong>Reason number 1</strong>: If <code>class Ext extends Base</code> means &quot;<code>Ext</code> also has a <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> just like <code>Base</code> does&quot;, then.. how would I extend <code>Ext</code> with the intent that I want to extend the raw type? You wouldn't be able to.</p>\n<p>in java 1.4, <code>List</code> is just <code>List</code>. It has no <code>&lt;E&gt;</code>. It can't - <strong>generics did not exist at all</strong>. Hence, code was out there writing <code>class Foo implements List</code> and the author of this code has no idea about generics. They think <code>add</code> takes any Object and <code>get</code> returns an Object. You <strong>cannot</strong> silently reinterpret this hypothetical <code>Foo</code> class as having invisible generics and have all possible code one could write that compiled fine on java 1.4 also compile fine in this world. The only way you can do that is with this raw type concept.</p>\n<p>Hence, <code>extends Base</code> means 'extend Base (the raw type)' and thus if you want to keep the generics, you have to write <code>class Foo&lt;T&gt; extends Base&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2>It's semantically correct</h2>\n<p>I am free to write:</p>\n<pre><code>class Base&lt;T extends Serializable&gt; {  }\nclass Ext&lt;T extends Number&gt; extends Base&lt;T&gt; { .. }\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have redefined the bounds here. This is legal. Hence, what you're proposing/thinking of is a shortcut: If I want to keep the generics and not redefine the bounds, what if we define the language specification that this is what happens when I don't specify these generics at all?</p>\n<p>But that's a bit odd then. If you want to keep the generics and keep the same bounds, you write nothing. If you want to keep the generics but change the bounds, you.. write <code>&lt;&gt;</code> all of a sudden. Inconsistent - that's bad in lang design.</p>\n<p>Ext has <em>its own</em> generics that lives independent of Base. You have to say that whilst independent, the T of Ext is fulfilling the T of base.</p>\n<p>The above points should then answer all your questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1.Why is it mandatory to mention the type parameter when extending a generic class?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There needs to be syntax to change the bounds anyway.</li>\n<li>There needs to be a way to say you want to extend the raw type.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2.What happens if I don't specify any type — instead just class Child extends Base?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You'd get the raw type. Your code compiles and might work, but the compiler will do no type checking on the generics at all, and will emit a warning when you compile explaining that its flying blind and will not give you the usual guarantees about type safety.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Why do I need to declare the child class with Generic if I'm not fixing the type to Base class?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not quite sure I understand, but if that means:</p>\n<p>Given A: <code>class Ext extends Base&lt;String&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Given B: <code>class Ext&lt;T&gt; extends Base&lt;T&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Then you mean with 'fixing the type to Base' as 'like A' and 'not fixing the type to Base' as 'like B in contrast to A' - then this boils down to the same question as your first.</p>\n",
