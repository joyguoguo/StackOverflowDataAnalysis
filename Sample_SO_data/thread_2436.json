    "title" : "How would I disable &quot;snapping&quot; of elements when moving them in Scene Builder?",
    "body" : "<p>I'm designing a UI in JavaFx and I'm using Scene Builder to do so, but I can't move any elements with precision due to the uncontrollable &quot;snapping&quot; of moving elements in scene builder which I can't turn off.</p>\n<p>When I try to move any element in scene builder (text, buttons, fields), I can't move them precisely at all and it always snaps to the wrong place (red lines) and can't move them in a way that takes the position of other elements in mind like google slides for example, so I just want to turn it off, but I cant. The only workaround I have found is manually changing the X and Y of an element to a precise value in the position portion of the &quot;Layout&quot; section but this is also not ideal. is there any way I can turn it off or at least make it better? Or some other way from more experienced javaFX designers to move elements around parallel to other elements / with more precision?</p>\n<p>Another problem is that when I move any element the right side of an anchor pane in scene builder, it ends up making the anchor pane bigger and makes the element stay where it was relative to the new size, but doesn't happen on the left side for some reason which is also pretty annoying but not as annoying as the other problem.\nThanks</p>\n",

Using <code>AnchorPane</code> to lay out <code>Button</code>, <code>TextArea</code>, and <code>TextField</code> is not recommended.  Your nodes should snap into place when you drop them into parent nodes like <code>VBox</code>, <code>GridPane</code>, <code>HBox</code>, and <code>BorderPane</code>. These parent nodes have rules that guide how they will lay out their child nodes.",
