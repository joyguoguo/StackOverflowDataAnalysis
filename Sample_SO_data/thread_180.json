    "body" : "<p>I've been working on creating a game using libGDX for a few months now, and so far I've successfully implemented the main gameplay loop inside a stage which uses fitviewport, which functions as intended, aka, keeps the correct aspect ratio of the game board and the way it reads input. However, right now I am trying to add a second stage, which implements extendviewport and serves simply as a background with a single menu button. I made a basic version of it to try and see how the two stages would interact, but after adding it to the resize method, despite the fitviewport being supposed to keep the aspect ratio of the board, it started being warped as well when the application was resized.</p>\n<pre><code>public void resize(int width, int height) {\n    super.resize(width, height);\n\n        if (boardView != null) {\n            boardView.update(width, height, true);\n        }\n\n        if(backStage != null) {\n            backView.update(width, height, true);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's how I tried to implement the stage with extendviewport:</p>\n<pre><code>    backView = new ExtendViewport(backWidth, backHeight);\n\n    backStage = new Stage(backView);\n\n    background = new Texture(&quot;_gameBackground/mountains.png&quot;);\n    Image bg = new Image(background);\n    bg.setFillParent(true);\n    bg.setScaling(Scaling.stretch);\n    backStage.addActor(bg);\n</code></pre>\n<p>How would you recommend I edit the resize method so that the fitviewport maintains its aspect ratio?</p>\n<p>Honestly, there are probably a dozen different mistakes I might be making, but I would appreciate any advice. This is the first time I'm trying to make two stages interact with one another, so I'm feeling kinda lost.</p>\n",
