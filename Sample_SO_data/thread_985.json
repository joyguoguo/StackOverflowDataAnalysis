    "body" : "<p>I've read a lot of post/examples that explain how to create the <code>JerseyConfig</code> bean extending the <code>ResourceConfig</code> class: all of them say that I need to register in <code>JerseyConfig</code> constructor all the resources I need it to map.</p>\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n<pre><code>@Configuration\n@ApplicationPath(“/resource”)\npublic class JerseyConfig extends ResourceConfig {\n\n   public JerseyConfig() {\n      register(HelloWorld.class);\n      property(ServletProperties.FILTER_FORWARD_ON_404, true);\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm working on a complex maven project made of tons of modules and the resulting application is built using profiles depending on the customer. So depending on the profile I may or may not have one or more resources in the final application.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to avoid the explicit registration of each resource? Or is there a more flexible way of doing it?</p>\n",

We are trying to use both jax-rs and spring mvc because it seems that jax-rs handles better the use of the output stream as response to a rest call, while spring mvc stores all in memory before sending data over the output stream",
