    "body" : "<p>My project setup is as follows :\nThere are two XSD's : sample1.xsd and sample2.xsd. The classes from these two xsd's are generated into two different packages in my java project : com.sample1 and com.sample2</p>\n<p>Now i have another xsd: master.xsd which has imports of the sample1.xsd and sample2.xsd as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;xs:import namespace=&quot;urn:iso:std:iso:20022:tech:xsd:sample1.001.001.04&quot; schemaLocation=&quot;iso/sample1.001.001.04.xsd&quot; /&gt;\n        \n    &lt;xs:import namespace=&quot;urn:iso:std:iso:20022:tech:xsd:sample2.008.001.03&quot; schemaLocation=&quot;iso/sample2.008.001.03.xsd&quot; /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now when i try to generate the classes the job is failing as it is trying to generate the classes into same directory and sample1 and sample2 have few classes that have the same name.</p>\n<p>I was looking into adding episode configuration to the pom.xml but the samples provided here <a href=\"https://github.com/highsource/jaxb-tools/tree/master/maven-plugin/samples/episode\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/highsource/jaxb-tools/tree/master/maven-plugin/samples/episode</a></p>\n<p>There is option to provide jar details, is there any way i can do this by specifying the package name for sample1 and sample2 classes.</p>\n",
