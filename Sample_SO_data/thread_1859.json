    "body" : "<p>When I tried doing research on this, everything I found was how to debug an application running under Tomcat. I'm trying to debug Tomcat itself, because something strange is happening that I can't explain.</p>\n<p>When I attach to my Tomcat instance and run inside of IntelliJ, it will debug the Spring Framework code, but then when it calls <code>forward</code> on <code>org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationDispatcher</code>, stepping into doesn't act like it knows where to go until it gets back down to Spring Framework.</p>\n<p>I made the assumption that tomcat was shipped with debugging removed for performance reasons. I downloaded the source and built it with debug turned on and ran that one, yet IntelliJ behaves exactly the same way.</p>\n<p>Can someone explain why and how I go about debugging into Tomcat itself?</p>\n",
