    "body" : "<p>In Java mission control 9 I am able to select various bits of information like time span, thread Id etc and use it to &quot;Store and set as focused selection&quot;. This globally changes all the views/pages to set the Focus and Aspect of the page to narrow down on information around the focus.</p>\n<p>But once I am done analyzing that focus area, I am not sure how to &quot;remove&quot; the focused selection globally. I searched through the PDF manual but could not find anything relevant. I know on each page I could select  for the focus page to sort of over-ride the global focus for that page temporarily, but that is not what I am looking for. I would like to know where I could clear out the selection so that I can start a fresh line of analysis.</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>In the top part of most pages you can switch what is currently the Focused (global) Selection. If you try changing to another page after changing it, you'll notice that the selection will follow you to another page. You can always switch to &lt;No Selection&gt; to start over (but yes, previous selections will still be available in the combo box).</p>\n<p>I take it that you're looking for a way to clear out all previous selections, and not just selecting the &quot;&lt;No Selection&gt;&quot;? If so, how would you want to access that functionality? A context menu with &quot;Clear All Selections&quot;? Something else? Please let me know what you'd prefer, and I'll open an issue and add it. :)</p>\n",

It&#39;s just that after adding a few selections, the menu becomes cluttered (with almost similar names)  and I would like it to be cleaned up for usability.  However, it would be a nice-to-have feature.  As for how I would like to see it.... either...  1. in a context menu  2. or in a top level menu",
