    "body" : "<p>Getting this error for schemaParser.parseSchemaObjects() when trying to update from Springboot 2 to 3, also this FieldSet is not something I have initialized, its coming from the graphql-java class itself. FYI, it is running fine on spring boot 2: &quot;Expected type 'FieldSet' to be a GraphQLInputType, but it wasn't! Was a type only permitted for object types incorrectly used as an input type, or vice versa?&quot;</p>\n<p>I mean, I am not using this FieldSet anywhere, its coming from some dependency not sure. The same code was working fine in other projects also</p>\n",
