    "body" : "<p>I wanted to utilize a global keylogger for my project and I went to <a href=\"https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook/releases\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook/releases</a> for downloading JNativeHook. I downloaded &quot;jnativehook-2.2.2.jar&quot; one and then added it to my project folder. I then configured the class path of my project and applied this file.</p>\n<p>However, even though the file shows up in &quot;Referenced Libraries&quot;, I simply cannot get the imports to work as they all say &quot;Cannot be resolved&quot;. Are there any steps I did wrong or I didn't do? I use macOS for my operating system.</p>\n",
