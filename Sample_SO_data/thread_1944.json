    "title" : "Call to Ceph object gateway returns 400",
    "body" : "<p>I am attempting to create an object on our Ceph instance and the only piece of information returned is that the request failed with a 400. I don't have direct access to Ceph logs as its managed by the other team, but they were only able to pull a small set of Ceph RGW logs that do not indicate the reason but only state the request completed with a 400.</p>\n<p>The client setup is fairly simple:</p>\n<pre><code>  public S3Client s3Client(S3Properties s3Properties) {\nreturn S3Client.builder()\n    .endpointOverride(URI.create(s3Properties.baseUrl()))\n    .region(Region.of(Region.EU_CENTRAL_1.id())) // Not used by Ceph but required by AWS SDK\n    .credentialsProvider(\n        StaticCredentialsProvider.create(\n            AwsBasicCredentials.create(s3Properties.accessKey(), s3Properties.secretKey())))\n    .forcePathStyle(true)\n    .build();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The put request is also very straight forward:</p>\n<pre><code>  var putRequest =\n      PutObjectRequest.builder()\n          .key(key)\n          .bucket(s3Properties.bucket())\n          .contentType(contentType)\n          .build();\n\n  PutObjectResponse putObjectResponse =\n      s3Client.putObject(putRequest, RequestBody.fromBytes(fileContent));\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've validated that the credentials are fine by listing the buckets on application startup. This works. The contentType is generated from the Apache Tika library.</p>\n<p>They key is &quot;/attachments/uuid/fileName.ext&quot;.</p>\n<p>I've played around with removing the forcePathStyle, did not work. The ops team stated they have too much traffic on RGW and cannot enable debug mode. Another interesting hint is that a team that is using the minio library for the client - has no issues without any additional configuration. Not sure how to debug this further.</p>\n<p>Locally I have a minio container setup for mocking the s3 storage - everything works as intended.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I was able to dig up that the cause is XAmzContentSHA256Mismatch. I'm not sure what is the cause though.</p>\n",

The Ceph version uses MD5 to generate the checksums, while the AWS SDK uses CRC32 resulting in a checksum mismatch.</p>\n<p>The AWS SDK lets you work around this by setting the requestChecksumCalculation field to RequestChecksumCalculation.WHEN_REQUIRED, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>    return S3Client.builder()\n        .endpointOverride(URI.create(s3Properties.baseUrl()))\n        .region(Region.of(Region.EU_CENTRAL_1.id())) // Not used by Ceph but required by AWS SDK\n        .credentialsProvider(\n            StaticCredentialsProvider.create(\n                AwsBasicCredentials.create(s3Properties.accessKey(), s3Properties.secretKey())))\n        .forcePathStyle(true)\n        .requestChecksumCalculation(RequestChecksumCalculation.WHEN_REQUIRED)\n        .build();\n</code></pre>\n",
