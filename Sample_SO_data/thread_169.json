    "title" : "Why does my Java code behave differently inside a loop when checking conditions using a HashSet?",
    "body" : "<p>I am trying to solve a coding problem where I need to repeatedly double a number (<code>original</code>) as long as it exists in an integer array. To make the lookup faster, I am inserting all elements of the array into a <code>HashSet</code>. My understanding is that this should allow constant-time <code>contains()</code> checks.</p>\n<p>However, when I put the doubling condition <strong>inside the loop that builds the set</strong>, my code fails on certain inputs. Here is the code:</p>\n<pre><code>public int findFinalValue(int[] nums, int original) {\n    Set&lt;Integer&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n    for (int num : nums) {\n        set.add(num);\n        if (set.contains(original)) {\n            original *= 2;\n        }\n    }\n    return original;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example, with <code>nums = [5,3,6,1,12]</code> and <code>original = 3</code>, this code returns <strong>12</strong>, but the correct result should be <strong>24</strong> because 3 → 6 → 12 → 24 (all appear in the array).</p>\n<p>When I move the condition outside the loop like this:</p>\n<pre><code>while (set.contains(original)) {\n    original *= 2;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>…it works correctly.</p>\n<p>My question is:</p>\n<p><strong>Why does checking <code>contains(original)</code> inside the same loop where the set is being built cause incorrect behavior?</strong><br />\nI assumed adding elements one by one and checking in the same pass should logically work, since ultimately the same set gets built.</p>\n<p>Is there some detail about iteration order, timing of updates, or HashSet behavior that I am misunderstanding?</p>\n<p>Any explanation about <em>why the logic only works after the full set is constructed</em> would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n",
