Even though it says Epic Link there which I think I read Feature Link was being renamed Epic? I know this particular value is within my <strong>customfields</strong> list and I know the value of that which is in the form like <strong>bob-1234</strong>.</p>\n<p>I need to be able to populate my combobox with a list of those as it does in jira itself.</p>\n<p>When doing that I still do not see the value that is on the website? It's still missing.</p>\n<p>When I do the query <strong>/field</strong> I can find the custom field and this is the json for it:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  “id”: “bob-1234”,\n  “name”: “Featured Link”,\n  “custom”: true,\n  “orderable”: true,\n  “navigable”: true,\n  “searchable”: true,\n  “clauseName”: [\n      &quot;xx[1234]&quot;,\n      “Epic Link”\n  ],\n  “schema”: {\n    “type”: “any”,\n    “custom”: “xxx.xxxx.xxxx.xx-epic-link”,\n    “customId”: “1234”\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>\n",
