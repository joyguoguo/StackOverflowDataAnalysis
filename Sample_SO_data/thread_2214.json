    "body" : "<p>I'm working on an AI code assistant plugin (think Cursor-lite) and I've hit a roadblock that's driving me crazy. Hoping someone here has dealt with something similar.\nOne of the features I'm working on is rendering markdown content in a high-quality, interactive way. Specifically, I want to support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Code blocks with a &quot;copy to clipboard&quot; button</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The ability to insert code into the currently opened file at the caret position</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>LaTeX rendering (ideally via MathJax or similar)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The challenge I'm running into is this: rendering high-quality markdown often involves using HTML + JS (e.g., in a JCEF browser component), but this approach makes it difficult to interact with the IDE's editor. For example, I can render nice markdown using HTML/JS, but inserting code into the file requires accessing the editor and performing a write action — which doesn't play well with JS-based rendering.</p>\n<p>Has anyone run into this kind of issue before? I'm open to any ideas or suggestions — especially if there's a clean way to render markdown with copy-to-clipboard and LaTeX support, while still being able to interact with the editor (e.g., insert code at the cursor).</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n",
