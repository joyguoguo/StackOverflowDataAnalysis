    "body" : "<p>I have a repository with multiple projects. There is a project which has all the 'integration-tests' in it.\nThe 'integration-tests' project runs as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checks if a service is up.</li>\n<li>If service is unavailable, launch the service using <code>AnnotationConfigApplicationContext</code></li>\n<li>Runs the tests which basically hits the service endpoint and validates the results.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When I run the tests through failsafe (mvn verify), it gives me only coverage for classes defined in 'integration-test' module. I want the coverage to go deeper and give me the coverage in classes defined in the service.</p>\n<p>Ideally I would want all the classes that belong to a certain namespace pattern 'abc.xyz.*'.\nThings I have tried:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In parent pom.xml, included the above pattern under <code>prepare-agent-integration</code></li>\n<li>Pass in <code>-javagent:../jacocoagent.jar</code> in mvn/jvm.config.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>None of these options work. Is it possible to even do this? If so, what can I do to make this work?</p>\n",
