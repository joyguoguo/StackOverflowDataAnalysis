    "body" : "<p>Let's imagine I have 2 Worker instances on different machines and 6 executors of some Bolt. Eventually, I have 3 executors per worker. But I want to add a memory cache in executors. If I create my cache in Bolt's prepare() method, I will have a cache instance per executor. If I have a key to put into the cache, I will do it 6 times instead of 2, since executor, as I understand, is just a thread, but multiple executors can go to 1 place if it's the same worker.<br />\nSo is there a way to do cache on a worker level to go there from all executors of that worker?</p>\n",
