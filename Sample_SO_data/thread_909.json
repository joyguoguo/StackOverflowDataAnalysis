    "body" : "<p>I’m currently working on a project that uses the <strong>PersonalImageClassifier</strong> extension. I wanted to share my experience and see if anyone can help me troubleshoot an issue I’m having with a no-code platform.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In &quot;App Inventor&quot;, the extension works perfectly. My application runs, PersonalImageClassifier loads and functions as expected, and I can initialize the classifier and make predictions without any problems.</li>\n<li>On &quot;Niotron&quot; (another no-code platform), when testing the project with Companion, the extension works correctly and all related blocks are triggered as expected.</li>\n<li>However, when I build the APK on Niotron, the application itself runs, but the extension does not load. The classifier does not initialize, and none of the related blocks (like <code>ClassifierReady</code>) are triggered.\nThe extension works correctly in an APK built with App Inventor; however, the same project and extension do not work properly in an APK built with Niotron—the application runs, but the extension does not load.</li>\n<li>Is there something specific I should check regarding compatibility with newer Android versions or platform settings?</li>\n<li>Could this be related to permissions, assets, or extension compatibility?\nAny advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated!\nIf anyone has experienced similar problems, please share your solution or any steps that helped you resolve it.\nThank you!</li>\n</ul>\n",
