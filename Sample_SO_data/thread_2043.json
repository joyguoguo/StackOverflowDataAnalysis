I plan to host the app on my own domain for demonstration purposes.</p>\n<p>If the application is later adopted by a client or company with their own domain, and they want the code to reflect their domain (e.g., changing com.myname to com.clientname), is it necessary or recommended to rename the packages?</p>\n<p>Is this a common practice in real-world projects?</p>\n<p>How difficult or routine is it to refactor all package names in a mature Java project?</p>\n<p>Are there best practices or tools (e.g., in IntelliJ IDEA) to make this process easier?

Your domain is one cog and your app is a different cog, at some point you connect then together.
