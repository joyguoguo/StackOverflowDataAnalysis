    "body" : "<p>I'm relatively new to Java and object oriented programming, and I don't understand why sometimes the constructor used in declaring and object will be a subclass of the objects type instead of the object type just being the subclass. Shown below:</p>\n<pre><code>//Super class as datatype\nSuperClass obj = new SubClass();\n\n//Sub class as datatype (causes error)\nSubClass obj = new SuperClass();\n\n//Real example I've seen:\nList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\n\n\n//why not just this?\nSubClass obj = new SubClass();\nArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>To my knowledge there's no difference between the code above and below, and I don't understand the advantage of writing like this. I'd normally try and figure this out by writing example code and testing things, but as far as I can tell they are interchangeable.</p>\n",

    "body" : "Just to try to clarify why you&#39;d use List on the left hand side and ArrayList on the right.  Most of the time you don&#39;t care about what kind of List things are.  As long as something conforms to the <code>List</code> interface your code will work with it.  This provides flexibility when others call your code.  If you always use the Concrete class (ie ArrayList) certain situations will require the caller to convert their representation into an ArrayList and that will be inefficient.  So prefer the interface over the concrete class when you don&#39;t have a reason to.",

    "body" : "To boil down the rule you should consider this.  When dealing with the assignment operator (<code>=</code>) the two sides of it must be able to complete the sentence truthfully &#39;The &lt;right hand side&gt; IS A &lt;left hand side&gt;&#39; .  So is <code>SuperClass</code> is a <code>SubClass</code>?  No, that is not true.  But the reverse is true.  Is SubClass is a SuperClass?  Yes because Subclass extends SuperClass.  When it comes to interfaces a similar statement can be used.  &#39;&lt;right hand side&gt; implements &lt;left hand side&gt;`  And ArrayList implements List so that&#39;s all good, but the reverse is not true.",
