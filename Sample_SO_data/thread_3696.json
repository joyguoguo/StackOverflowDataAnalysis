    "title" : "How to get OCPP charging station parameters",
    "body" : "<p>I'm new to OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) and I have significant difficulties to start diving in subject, any help will be highly appropriated.</p>\n<p>I need to write a kind of monitoring tool which should connect to charging station via OCPP and get a set of parameters from it. For example, max charging power, current charging percentage etc.\nI use online OCPP charging station emulator (<a href=\"https://cs.ocpp-css.com/ocpp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://cs.ocpp-css.com/ocpp</a> (login: demo, password: demo), <a href=\"https://github.com/apostoldevel/ocpp-cs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/apostoldevel/ocpp-cs</a>) to test my development.</p>\n<p>First of all, I can not find the actual Java library to work with OCPP. <a href=\"https://github.com/ChargeTimeEU/Java-OCA-OCPP\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/ChargeTimeEU/Java-OCA-OCPP</a> looks abandoned. I tried it, but I was not able even to connect to the emulator. After establishing the connection I immediately get a disconnect.<br />\nMay be you can suggest me a working Java library.</p>\n<p>I tried to use Kotlin library <a href=\"https://github.com/IZIVIA/ocpp-toolkit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/IZIVIA/ocpp-toolkit</a>.\nI was able to connect to the station and pass through the authorization. But I don't know what to do next. How to get parameters?</p>\n<p>Here is my code:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>private static void testOcppConnection() throws ConnectException {\n    final var chargePointId = &quot;EFACECQCTEST&quot;;\n    ChargePointOperations connection = ApiFactory.Companion.ocpp16ConnectionToCSMS(chargePointId,\n            &quot;ws://ws.ocpp-css.com/ocpp&quot;,\n            TransportEnum.WEBSOCKET,\n            null,\n            null,\n            Collections.emptyList(),\n            new OcppCallbacks());\n\n    connection.connect();\n    final var idTag = &quot;demo&quot;;\n    var authResponse = connection.authorize(new RequestMetadata(chargePointId, null), new AuthorizeReq(idTag)).getResponse();\n    if (authResponse.getIdTagInfo().getStatus() ==  AuthorizationStatus.Accepted) {\n        log.info(&quot;Auth accepted&quot;);\n        var transactionResponse = connection.startTransaction(new RequestMetadata(chargePointId, null), new StartTransactionReq(1, idTag, 0,\n                Instant.Companion.fromEpochSeconds(java.time.Instant.now().getEpochSecond(), 0), null)).getResponse();\n        var transactionId = transactionResponse.getTransactionId();\n        log.info(&quot;Start transaction: {}&quot;, transactionId);\n        log.info(&quot;{}&quot;, transactionResponse.getIdTagInfo());\n        //What to do next???\n    } else {\n        log.info(&quot;Auth rejected&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n",
