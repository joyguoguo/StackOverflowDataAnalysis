    "body" : "<p>I'm trying to use JTable to make a 9x9 grid, and then use a BorderColorRenderer to set every 3rd column and row to have a thicker line (think sudoku board). I can easily get it working one way (i.e. only columns or only rows), which makes sense with my current code:</p>\n<pre><code>private static class BorderColorRenderer extends DefaultTableCellRenderer {\n    public Component getTableCellRendererComponent(JTable table, Object value, boolean isSelected, boolean hasFocus, int row, int column) {\n        Border border;\n        JComponent comp = (JComponent)super.getTableCellRendererComponent(table, value, isSelected, hasFocus, row, column);\n        \n        if(column%3 == 0) {\n            border = BorderFactory.createMatteBorder(0, 2, 0, 0, Color.BLACK);\n        }else if(column==8){\n            border = BorderFactory.createMatteBorder(0, 0, 0, 2, Color.BLACK);\n        }else {\n            border = BorderFactory.createMatteBorder(0, 0, 0, 0, Color.BLACK);\n        }\n        \n        \n        comp.setBorder(border);\n        return comp;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Obviously, it is &quot;resetting&quot; the borders each time, so when I add another if to the end to check rows it will reset the 0, 2, 0, 0 and make the 2 a 0 (so regular border).</p>\n<p>My idea was to get the current border values, which I can do with getInsets(), and then use those values to add a 2 where I need it (when a column line and row line intersect/occur in the same cell of the table). However, getInsets() returns an Inset object, and I can't access any of the values in it nor covert to an array (as far as I have tried).</p>\n<p>How can I go about doing this?</p>\n",

To &quot;convert it to an array&quot; as you have requested, you would need to decide on a packing order:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>static int[] insetsToArray(Insets insets) {\n     return new int[] { insets.left, insets.top, insets.right, insets.bottom };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also consider that some method <code>getInsets</code> <em>may</em> be pure, in that it creates a new object instead of reporting a retained object. In that case, simply modifying the provided object is not sufficient to affect the provider's internal state, you would need to reapply it with the matching setter (look for <code>setInsets</code>).</p>\n",

At some point in the future, you will want to do even a bit more graphical stuff in that game, like line thickness/strikethrough, coloring, mouse-over or fade effects. Using a JTable - as your question proves - is way more complicated (looking at even only the <b>basic</b> components of a Sudoku game), than just using a JPanel where you override its <code>paintChildren(Graphics g)</code> method and do the whole painting thing in there. Call <code>repaint()</code> to have Swing invoke the <code>paintX()</code>methods.",

Why would you do such complicated messy stuff, when you simply can override the <code>paint()</code>/<code>paintX()</code>methods and use the <code>Graphics</code>/<code>Graphics2D</code>?
