We've tried the 'setReadOnly();' workaround that others have described, and there's a similar question <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78861863/google-play-games-services-c-does-not-initialize-after-updating-target-sdk-f\">here</a>, but it doesn't help. We were wondering if anyone has recent experience?</p>\n",
