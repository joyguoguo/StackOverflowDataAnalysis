    "title" : "NewRelic: Ignore Spring Boot Actuator Transactions",
    "body" : "<p>We've got NewRelic integrated into Spring Boot. I don't know why but since yesterday  NR identifies all requests to actuator endpoints (including the health check and prometheus endpoints that get polled very frequently) as web transactions and tracks them accordingly.</p>\n<p>The additional traffic is adding a serious traffic overhead to some of our internal systems that are not web facing. This means that problems become harder to see (all the health check requests are super quick and successful, so the error rates of the application become much lower and therefore harder to notice. also response times and APEX score are now looking super good but are in fact meaningless.</p>\n<p>I've tried to disable NR for the /actuator endpoint in various ways, but I seem to be unable to do so. I've tried to add a custom instrumentation to ignore the transaction (via XML upload and in the UI) but this does not help. Other than this, the only way to ignore the transaction is via code, but as actuator is part of the spring framework I am not able to modify its code.</p>\n<p>Do you have any suggestions on how to make NR ignore the actuator endpoint that actually works?</p>\n",
