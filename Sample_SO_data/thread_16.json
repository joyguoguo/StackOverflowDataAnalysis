    "body" : "<p>I'm trying to parse HTTP requests for fun and I'm currently stuck because the method I'm using blocks until input is received.</p>\n<pre><code>byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nwhile (!request.isDone()) {\n  int n = input.read(buffer);\n\n  if (n == -1) {\n    break;\n  }\n  request.parseRequest(buffer, n);\n}\nreturn request;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm trying to read into a buffer and parsing the request until it's done. I have a small class which creates a <code>ServerSocket</code> where I send in a simple <code>curl</code> request such as <code>curl -v http://localhost:5000/hello</code>. When my buffer is of a much smaller size like 8 bytes, the request is read in chunks and parsed correctly. But when my buffer is much bigger and can read the entire request in one go, only the request line gets parsed. Then, the loop above gets returned to and blocks on the third line where it needs to read. But <code>curl</code> keeps the connection alive and my program is just waiting for input that's never sent. Is there a viable solution to my problem as is other than looking for a non-blocking socket in java?</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>The issue you're encountering is a classic HTTP parsing problem... When your buffer is large enough to read the entire request in one go, <code>input.read(buffer)</code> successfully reads all the data, but then the loop continues and calls <code>read()</code> again. Since the client (curl) has sent everything and is waiting for a response, your server blocks waiting for more data that will never come.</p>\n<p>One of clean solution is to ensure your <code>request</code> object properly tracks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Whether headers are complete (found <code>\\r\\n\\r\\n</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Whether a body is expected (check <code>Content-Length</code> or <code>Transfer-Encoding</code> headers)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How many body bytes have been received vs. expected</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then simply don't call <code>read()</code> again once <code>isDone()</code> returns true:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint n;\nwhile((n = input.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n    request.parseRequest(buffer, n);\n    \n    if(request.isDone()) {\n        break; // Exit immediately when done\n    }\n}\nreturn request;\n</code></pre>\n<p>For a GET request like your curl example, there's no request body, so once you've parsed the headers (ending with <code>\\r\\n\\r\\n</code>), your <code>isDone()</code> should return <code>true</code> and you should exit the loop immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>You need to detect completion from the HTTP protocol itself, not from the socket closing or blocking.</strong></p>\n",

I realized my while loop wasn&#39;t exactly right and also that the request should rely on itself since it tracks the state and the buffer. i originally had it so that it returned once the requestline was parsed and the state was updated, then it would read the next chunk of data (i assumed requests wouldnt come in one read and tested with a buffer of only 8 bytes) and parse the next section and so on. i realized that the buffer should be checked if the state is updated to see if the next section should be parsed",
