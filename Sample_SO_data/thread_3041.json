    "title" : "Quarkus and dynamic MicroProfile properties during build time",
    "body" : "<p>We're using Quarkus as a framework to build our microservices. Important note: I have a Spring Framework background, so correct me if I am wrong.</p>\n<p>From what I understand, Quarkus, in contrast with Spring Framework, does a lot of things at build time via build plugin and appropriate extensions. In particular, Quarkus resolves the configuration properties (I mean MicroProfile's <code>@ConfigProperty</code>) during build time. That basically means if the property <code>x.y.z</code> defined in the quarkus extension, and it does not have a default value, <strong>it is assumed that I must provide a value for that property during a build time</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now, the problem is - assume I'm writing a <strong>library</strong>, and by library I mean the peace of Java software that is not executable on its own. It is supposed to included into applications as a dependency.</p>\n<p>And now, this library includes as a dependency the quarkus extension that has a Config Property without default value. According to my understanding of how quarkus is designed, I'm supposed to provide a value at build time for this property, but <strong>what that value is supposed to be? I do not know it during a build time. What is the Quarkus idiomatic way of dealing with this problem?</strong></p>\n<p>I want to clarify - I know, that I can later override the value for that property, for instance by providing <code>-D</code> JVM system property. The question is more about the way this problem is typically addressed in Quarkus. <strong>In other words, what properties are typically supplied during the build time to Quarkus in this case, if any at all?</strong></p>\n",

Quarkus extensions may have build time configuration, where that is correct and configuration must be provided at build time, but they may also have runtime configuration, where configuration is only read at runtime.</p>\n<p>In the Quarkus documentation, build time configuration is typically marked by a lock icon -- if there is no lock, the configuration is runtime and you don't have to provide a value during build.</p>\n",
