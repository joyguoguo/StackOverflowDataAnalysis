    "body" : "<p>I'm trying to add a Global Variable named host that dynamically reflects the current instance where the application is running.</p>\n<p>I'm working with TIBCO BW 5 applications, which are configured via .xml files on the front end, and run as pure Java code on the backend.</p>\n<p>What I've tried so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manual injection into Application.xml: This works, but only when I manually set the value per instance. Without a proper script to inject the correct value on Instance A and another for Instance B, deployment in a clustered environment doesn't behave as expected—it ends up using the hardcoded value.</li>\n<li>Modifying bwengine.tra and designer.tra: I attempted this based on suggestions from various LLMs, but unfortunately, it had no effect.</li>\n<li>Using a shared .projlib or manipulating the .jar: I explored both options, but neither yielded a successful outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: I'm specifically looking for a solution that does not involve using the Administrator GUI.</p>\n<p>Has anyone encountered this issue before or found a reliable workaround?</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>It depends from what you are trying to acheive.</p>\n<p>If the goal is just to expose BusinessWorks HTTP endpoints to a load balancer you can do the following:</p>\n<p>. Configure the HTTP connection resource with hostname set to localhost<br />\n. Use the bw.plugin.http.server.defaultHost property and set it also to localhost</p>\n<p>The mentioned property can be set once for all by adding the following line in the bwengine.tra file:<br />\njava.property.bw.plugin.http.server.defaultHost=localhost</p>\n<p>You can also set it at deployment time by following the explanations available in the 'Setting Custom Engine Properties in Deployed Projects' section of the BusinessWorks Administrator guide.</p>\n<p>If the goal is to set a given hostname for each BusinessWorks engine in the runtime environment you can do the following:</p>\n<p>. Create a Global Variable and configure it with the Service option<br />\n. Use this Global Variable to set the hostname of your HTTP connection resource<br />\n. Then at Deployment time in the Advanced tab available at the Service instance level set the Global Variable value to the desired value for each Service instance</p>\n<p>There is no way to set the hostname dynamically and this won't really make sence because a machine can have multiple hostnames.</p>\n<p>Regards</p>\n<p>Emmanuel</p>\n",
