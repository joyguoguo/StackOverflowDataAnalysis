    "title" : "Couchbase client fails with OutOfMemoryError on too many waiting threads",
    "body" : "<p>I have a Java batch application that performs several processing steps on a Couchbase bucket hosted in a single node cluster. The database is neither big nor required to be lightning fast, just about 500 MB of data.</p>\n<p>The different application components (<a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/java-ee-7-batch-processing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java Batch</a> ItemReader, ItemProcessor or ItemWriter) connect to Couchbase each via the java-sdk. They do it in parallel or repeatedly, thus a single batch run results in many calls to <code>Cluster.connect()</code>.</p>\n<p>While this was running fine, since a week I perceive timeouts and OutOfMemoryErrors.</p>\n<pre><code>[16.081s][warning][os,thread] Failed to start thread &quot;Unknown thread&quot; - pthread_create failed (EAGAIN) for attributes: stacksize: 256k, guardsize: 4k, detached.\n[16.082s][warning][os,thread] Failed to start the native thread for java.lang.Thread &quot;boundedElastic-evictor-225&quot;\n13:11:59.543 [jberet-1] ERROR org.jberet - JBERET000007: Failed to run job createTickets, createTickets, org.jberet.job.model.Step@78739007\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create native thread: possibly out of memory or process/resource limits reached\n    at java.base/java.lang.Thread.start0(Native Method) ~[?:?]\n    at java.base/java.lang.Thread.start(Unknown Source) [?:?]\n    at java.base/java.lang.System$2.start(Unknown Source) ~[?:?]\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Adding the JVM option <code>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError</code> does not trigger heap dumps. Increasing the heap did not help either but I discovered more than 2000 waiting threads before the error occurs. Almost all of the threads are related to the Couchbase connections. This limits my application in processing further data.</p>\n<p>I checked in the code that all the Couchbase connections get closed when no longer needed - yet the amount of threads remains and seems not to go away.</p>\n<p>There is <a href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/troubleshoot-outofmemoryerror-unable-to-create-new\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an article</a> that describes the symptom of OutOfMemoryError on the client side caused by resource constraints on the server side (Apache Cassandra NoSQL DB, in my case it is Couchbase). I checked the admin interface, but there is no indication of any problem.</p>\n<p>What can be the root cause for this behaviour? What should I look at to find out more?</p>\n<p>Threads analysis: Short before death the JVM was running 2073 threads. Removing trailing numbers from thread names, I find these counts:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1Ky8yQQ3.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1Ky8yQQ3.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>While investigating further I found JVMs with even more than 3000 threads before dying. From the thread dump I can see many threads are waiting for Couchbase Locks. Here is an example:</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;cb-txn-cleanup-230&quot; daemon prio=5 Id=2311 WAITING on java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject@1472208d\n&quot;cb-comp-994&quot; daemon prio=5 Id=2004 TIMED_WAITING on java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject@446e7065\n</code></pre>\n<p>Looks like I am facing a client-side deadlock.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>\nI suspect I ran into some special situation - not sure how to proove that.\nFor date handling we followed <a href=\"https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/howtos/json.html#dates\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/howtos/json.html#dates</a> which suggests to register your own ObjectMapper which has registered the JavaTimeModule. This is shown in <a href=\"https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/howtos/json.html#ObjectMapper\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/howtos/json.html#ObjectMapper</a>, which creates it's own ClusterEnvironment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/825Ng9MT.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/825Ng9MT.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>But then here - out of context for the problem we tried to solve - you see a warning that resources might not get cleaned up if you create your own environment: <a href=\"https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html#multiple-clusters\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html#multiple-clusters</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Kj8DfMGy.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Kj8DfMGy.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>\n<p>So many people asked for code to analyze. Now, knowing what to look for I recreated the problem. Here is the code:</p>\n<pre><code>import com.couchbase.client.java.Cluster;\nimport com.couchbase.client.java.ClusterOptions;\nimport com.couchbase.client.java.codec.JacksonJsonSerializer;\nimport com.couchbase.client.java.env.ClusterEnvironment;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.JavaTimeModule;\nimport java.lang.management.ManagementFactory;\nimport java.time.Duration;\nimport java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;\nimport org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;\nimport org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;\n\npublic class CouchbaseProblem {\n  private static final Logger log = LogManager.getLogger();\n  \n  public static Cluster connectSimple(String connectionString, String username, String password) {\n    return Cluster.connect(connectionString, username, password);\n  }\n\n  public static Cluster connectWithEnv(String connectionString, String username, String password) {\n    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n    mapper.registerModule(new JavaTimeModule());\n\n    ClusterEnvironment environment = ClusterEnvironment.builder()\n            .jsonSerializer(JacksonJsonSerializer.create(mapper))\n            .build();\n    ClusterOptions co = ClusterOptions.clusterOptions(username, password);\n    co.environment(environment);\n    return Cluster.connect(connectionString, co);\n  }\n  \n  public static int getThreadCount() {\n    return ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean().getThreadCount();\n  }\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n    int max = 100;\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; max; i++) {\n      log.info(&quot;Simple Iteration {}/{}, Threads {}&quot;, i, max, getThreadCount());\n      \n      Cluster c = connectSimple(args[0], args[1], args[2]);\n      Thread.sleep(Duration.of(1, ChronoUnit.SECONDS));\n      c.disconnect();\n    }\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; max; i++) {\n      log.info(&quot;Env Iteration {}/{}, Threads {}&quot;, i, max, getThreadCount());\n      \n      Cluster c = connectWithEnv(args[0], args[1], args[2]);\n      Thread.sleep(Duration.of(1, ChronoUnit.SECONDS));\n      c.disconnect();\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see two loops, each of them creating and closing Couchbase connections. While running they log the iteration and the number of threads the JVM needs to care about.</p>\n<p>You can see the first loop's threadcount is growing but then levels off at 40, but the second loop's threadcount continually grows to over 2200.</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>I was able to resolve the situation. There were about 400 connects/disconnects during such a batch run. Not all the disconnect/cleanup seems to have worked as intended.</p>\n<p>I created a connection pool that essentially connects once to Couchbase, then allows all the components to benefit from that one connection. On top of that I added some indexing which also sped up Couchbase answering requests.</p>\n<p>The jobs are running successfully again.</p>\n<p>However I'd like to comment that to implement the pool I had to wrap the Cluster into my own class. It detaches the business logic from the real Cluster and thus can prevent disconnect/closure requests. This required changes all over the business logic to use the new class. Hence it is a very custom solution. I wish Cluster were or had an interface instead of a class. Maybe something to come true in a future version of the API?</p>\n<p>Some time later, and investigating on other stuff about Couchbase I stumble over the warning at <a href=\"https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html#multiple-clusters\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html#multiple-clusters</a>:</p>\n<p><em>When you manually create a <code>ClusterEnvironment</code>, the SDK will not shut it down when you call <code>Cluster.disconnect()</code>. Instead, you are responsible for shutting it down after disconnecting all clusters that share the environment.</em></p>\n<p>Now this is the case in my code: I customized the environment to use FasterXML Jackson for JSON parsing with the JavaTimeModule active, maybe leading into the above issue in first place. I still need to learn how to provide this <a href=\"https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html#cluster-environment\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">configuration callback</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n<p>Now I have proof that using the configuration callback does prevent the situation indeed.

The API should emit a warning when creating too many ClusterEnvironments rather than too many Clusters.</p>\n",
