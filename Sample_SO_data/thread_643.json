    "title" : "Android project using untiy-classes.jar (generated by Unity) with some classes that can&#39;t be resolved",
    "body" : "<p>I work on a small android project that uses the <code>unity-clases.jar</code> generated by Unity. Some (not all) of the files/classes in the <code>.jar</code> can't be resolved when compiling the android project and I don't understand why.</p>\n<p>I've unzipped the <code>.jar</code> files, it contains these files :\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xFVV9s3i.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xFVV9s3i.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>I ran the <code>javap</code> utility on some of these files, they are generated with java 17, and they all have a strange warning &quot;<code>Warning: File ./Xxxx.class does not contain class Xxxx</code>&quot; that I don't understand because each <code>Xxxx.class</code> file actually contains the definition of the class <code>Xxxx</code>, as shown by the same utility <code>javap</code> output. See example below with class &quot;IUnityPlayerLifecycleEvents&quot;.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wjMUoqaY.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wjMUoqaY.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>When I try to compile my android project, I get this kind of <code>Unresolved reference</code> errors :\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oV5DIVA4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oV5DIVA4.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>When I open the project on Android Studio (Narwhal), I can see that some of the classes defined in the unity-classes.jar are recognized, and some are not. Here is an example screenshot of a kotlin file in Android Studio.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8Mq2PMNT.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8Mq2PMNT.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>When I try to autocomplete com.unity3d.player on Android Studio, I can see the list of classes in unity-classes.jar that are recognized, see screenshot below.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/I7TNrQWk.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/I7TNrQWk.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Something else I don't understand, when displaying one of the recognised <code>unity-classes.jar</code> classes in Android Studio (via right click and &quot;<code>go to definition</code>&quot;), it says it's <strong>java 8 bytecode</strong>. But when unzipping my self the <code>unity-classes.jar</code> files and opening the same file/class in Android Studio, it says it is <strong>java 17 bytecode</strong> (consistent with javap utility output previously seen). See screenshots below.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nSWqV0SP.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nSWqV0SP.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VC6MxQft.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VC6MxQft.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n",
