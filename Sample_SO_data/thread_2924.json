    "body" : "<p>So it turned out the problem was that I made the test method private. Once I removed the private and left the default (which is package-private, from what I understand), the test ran smoothly:</p>\n<pre><code>import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\n\nclass MinimalTest {\n    \n    @Test\n    void testThatWillExecute() //No access modifier specified\n    {\n        assertTrue(false);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now that I know what to look for, I've found that this is actually mentioned in the JUnit documentation at <a href=\"https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-classes-and-methods\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-classes-and-methods</a>, though I wonder why that is the case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Class and method visibility</p>\n<p>Test classes, test methods, and lifecycle methods are not required to be public, but they must not be private.</p>\n<p>It is generally recommended to omit the public modifier for test classes, test methods, and lifecycle methods unless there is a technical reason for doing so – for example, when a test class is extended by a test class in another package. Another technical reason for making classes and methods public is to simplify testing on the module path when using the Java Module System.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
