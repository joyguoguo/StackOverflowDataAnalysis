    "body" : "<p>lucene-core has vulnerable issue and caught in the <strong>sonatype-2025-000439</strong>. Fortify identified as High priority issue.</p>\n<p>Is there any other ways to get rid of this issue from Fortify? Any work arounds can make it out from Fortify?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, no lucene-core versions without vulnerabilities available.</p>\n<p>The <code>lucene-core</code> package is vulnerable due to Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value. The <code>growExact()</code> method in the <code>ArrayUtil</code> class allocates unlimited new byte arrays on memory based on untrusted user input when parsing queries. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious query, that, when processed by the affected library will cause an Out Of Memory exception possibly leading to a DoS condition.</p>\n<p>Component Name: <em>org.apache.lucene:lucene-core</em></p>\n",
