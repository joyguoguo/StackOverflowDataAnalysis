    "body" : "<p>I'm using kotlin 19 and JVM 21.</p>\n<p>We recently moved to maverick-synergy-client 3.1.2 (upgraded from 3.0.11 where everything worked well).\nThis issue occurs without any additional dependencies.</p>\n<p>Also tried using version 3.1.0 and got the same result.</p>\n<p>When trying to create a private key to be used in maverick-synergy-client I got an error &quot;Unable to locate a cryptographic provider&quot;</p>\n<p>Here's the code which I'm using to create the key:</p>\n<pre><code>val baseKey = &quot;&quot;&quot;\n            -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n            [replace_this]\n            -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;.trimIndent()\n\n        val privateKey = &quot;mt-private-key&quot;\n\n        return try {\n            SshKeyUtils.getPrivateKey(baseKey.replace(&quot;[replace_this]&quot;, privateKey), uhlsportProperties.passphrase)\n        } catch (e: Exception) {\n            null\n        }\n        return null\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Before upgrading, instead of failing, the following code was triggered in maverick-synergy-client which returned correctly:</p>\n<pre><code>OpenSSHPrivateKeyFile(formattedkey)\n</code></pre>\n<p>After upgrading, the function <code>getPrivateKey</code> is failing and returning the error &quot;Unable to locate a cryptographic provider&quot;</p>\n<p>I Tried using an older key directly as a string in order to avoid the key string replacement, also started using <code>SshClientBuilder</code> from Maverick, but no success with creating the key for the client.</p>\n<p>Note that I need to use string replacement because the real key is stored in a vault which cannot a very long string or line breaks, but I don't think this is the issue.</p>\n<p>Why this is happening and how I can fix it?</p>\n",
