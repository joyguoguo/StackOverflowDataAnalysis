    "body" : "<p>I'm making a program where a server listens for requests from a client. My problem arises when the client sends a request and the server has to determine which kind of request it is in order to handle it.</p>\n<p>My naive approach is to use a serializable object that wraps an enum representing the request type along with the data needed to process it, and then use switch statements to handle each specific request. But what if the program scales? It becomes cumbersome to write a lot of switch statements.</p>\n<p>I found another way where each request type has a class linked to an action through an interface, and I handle them using a HashMap. Is this approach efficient, or is it too much overhead? Maybe I’m confusing things.</p>\n<p>Please give me some guidelines on how to work with this. Thanks!</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>This is far, far too broad. It describes <em>every</em> single TCP server, SOAP service, REST API, gRPC service and all others.</p>\n<p>Obviously, all of these have solved this problem. Many use different endpoints or URLs for different requests. Many use request headers. In SOAP services the <em>message</em> type defines the request, in document-oriented services, where the services exchange documents between them, and process them based on rules and workflows. In RPC-like SOAP services, you specify the operation when you call the service and pass the operation parameters in the body.</p>\n<p>Frameworks for all these server types automatically map the incoming request to the correct operation without manual switches.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Spring Boot REST service</a> guide, an HTTP GET request to <code>/greeting</code> is automatically mapped by the framework to the <code>greeting</code> method :</p>\n<pre><code>@RestController\npublic class GreetingController {\n\n    private static final String template = &quot;Hello, %s!&quot;;\n    private final AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong();\n\n    @GetMapping(&quot;/greeting&quot;)\n    public Greeting greeting(@RequestParam(defaultValue = &quot;World&quot;) String name) {\n        return new Greeting(counter.incrementAndGet(), template.formatted(name));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n",
