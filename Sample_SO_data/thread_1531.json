    "title" : "Getting used memory on Redis instance using Redis Enterprise REST API",
    "body" : "<p>In my firm, we have Redis clusters and use the APIs from this page for various metadata purpose.\nFor example, this is used to get the memory limit on a Redis instance as well as supported module information.\n<a href=\"https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/bdbs/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/bdbs/</a></p>\n<p>Now as part of some enhancement, I need to write a logic so that if used memory breaches a particular threshold from the memory limit then some kind of eviction mechanism or some custom code needs to be invoked.</p>\n<p>I am going through the above link but not getting a clear way to get the used memory at a  given time. Does anyone have an idea as to what may be a good approach?</p>\n",
