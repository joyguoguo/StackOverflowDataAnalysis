    "title" : "How to isolate code coverage to specific interactions, excluding Spring Boot startup, in IntelliJ Ultimate?",
    "body" : "<p>I want to use IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate's &quot;Run with Coverage&quot; on a Spring Boot app to see which lines are executed during manual testing (e.g., hitting an endpoint with Postman).</p>\n<p>My goal is to isolate the coverage from my specific interaction, completely ignoring the initial coverage generated during the application's startup. This is for manual analysis, not for automated tests.</p>\n<p>When I use &quot;Run with Coverage&quot;, the report is immediately cluttered with thousands of lines from the Spring Boot initialization process. This makes it impossible to see the coverage for just my manual API call. I've tried using the &quot;Close Coverage Report&quot; (trash can icon) in the Coverage tool window, but this seems to end the session rather than just resetting the data for the currently running process.</p>\n<p>How can I get a &quot;clean&quot; coverage report that only contains the code executed by my manual actions after the application is already running?</p>\n<p>For example, is there a way to:</p>\n<p>&quot;Reset&quot; the current coverage data on the live application before I run my manual test?</p>\n<p>&quot;Start/Stop&quot; the coverage recording at will?</p>\n<p>Configure the runner to only start recording after the application is fully initialized?</p>\n",
