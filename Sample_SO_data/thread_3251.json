    "body" : "<p>I am running a Jenkins controller on a Linux machine with OpenJDK 17.0.14, and my build agent is a Windows machine with OpenJDK 17.0.12. I have encountered an issue during the archiveArtifacts step in my Jenkins pipeline, where the build fails with a java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException.</p>\n<p>On the Jenkins controller, the following error appears in the logs:</p>\n<p><code>hudson.remoting.ProxyException: java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException at jenkins.agents.WebSocketAgents$Session.closed(WebSocketAgents.java:160) at jenkins.websocket.WebSockets$2.onWebSocketClose(WebSockets.java:105) at jenkins.websocket.Jetty12EE9Provider$2.onWebSocketClose(Jetty12EE9Provider.java:164) ... </code></p>\n<p>At the same time, the agent logs indicate that the agent was automatically disconnected and then reconnected.</p>\n<p>My setup is as follows:\nJenkins Controller: Linux machine with OpenJDK 17.0.14</p>\n<p>Jenkins Agent: Windows machine with OpenJDK 17.0.12</p>\n<p>WebSocket communication is being used (-webSocket flag set)</p>\n<p>Has anyone encountered a similar issue where the agent gets disconnected during the archiveArtifacts step? What could be causing the ClosedChannelException, and how can I resolve this?</p>\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>Ensured that both the Jenkins controller and agent are using compatible versions of Java (both are OpenJDK 17).</p>\n<p>Checked network stability and confirmed that there are no issues with connectivity.</p>\n<p>Reviewed Jenkins and agent logs, which show that the agent disconnects during the archive step and attempts to reconnect.</p>\n",
