    "body" : "<p>I was making a custom minecraft mod and everything was working, but then out of nowhere it gave me <code>com.intellij.execution.CantRunException: No JDK for module 'aetherian-tools-and-ores-template-1.21.1.main</code>, which has happened before but I was unable to fix it this time. Yes I do have a JDK selected. It works perfectly fine if I do <code>./gradlew runClient</code> in the terminal. Refreshing gradle, re-importing the project, invalidating caches, and restarting intelij has not helped. The module SDK is also set to project</p>\n",
