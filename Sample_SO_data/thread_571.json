    "title" : "Why does debugging require searching for the sunrsasign.jar while in fact it does not exist in JDK 1.8",
    "body" : "<p>When I debug the springboot project in idea, the exception occurs: java.io.FileNotFoundException: \\C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_191\\jre\\lib\\sunrsasign.jar， But in fact, the JDK 1.8 used in the project does not have this file, and I cannot find any association with this exception from the code and configuration, which makes me very confused</p>\n<p>I tried to clear the target directory of the project and rebuild it, as well as create an empty file named sunrsasign.jar in the corresponding directory, but in fact, the operating system does not allow this. I checked the idea configuration and did not find any obvious problems with the JDK version information. When searching online, due to historical issues, the jar package was integrated into another place, so normal debugging should not find this file. Of course, this is my guess, and I don't actually know why JVM searches for this file when debugging runs</p>\n",

We would have noticed if all versions from Java 5 to Java 8 had the problem of not allowing debugging. Normally, the JVM has no issue with path entries referring to non-existing files. It must be a tool of your debug infrastructure which tries to read all files in that path without tolerance toward non-existing files.</p>\n<p>So your options are</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>update the Java version</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>update your debug tool(s)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>override the bootclasspath using <code>-Xbootclasspath</code>, to only include the existing files</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
