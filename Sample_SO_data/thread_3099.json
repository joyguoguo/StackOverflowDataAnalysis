    "title" : "How to Extract Data from Java Drag-and-Drop into PySide2 Application",
    "body" : "<p>I have a Java GUI application with a treeView widget, where drag-and-drop is already enabled. I drag an item from the treeView and try to drop it into another application built using Python and PySide2. This second application has a QTableWidget with the Drop property set to True.</p>\n<p>However, when I drag and drop the item, I don't get the exact text that I expect. Instead, I receive the following data:</p>\n<pre><code>java dataflavor: application/x-java-serialized-object class=com.customPackage.Treeset.CompObjSet\n</code></pre>\n<p>How can I extract the actual data from this?\nIs there any way to check if the dropped data contains useful information or if it's in a serializable object format? Any insights on how to handle this ?</p>\n",

Or if that doesn&#39;t work, it may be serialised as json, so you could try e.g. <code>json.loads( bytes(mimedata.data()).decode())</code>. However, if you&#39;re unlucky, the object may be serialised using a custom binary format that&#39;s only readable by the originating java application. For proprietary software, there would probably be nothing more you can do; but for open-source, it should be possible to reverse-engineer the format.",

    "body" : "The fact that the mime is named &quot;x-java-<b>serialized</b>-object&quot; should be a clear hint. Qt item views normally accept drops only in its own serialized data built from other item views, and it&#39;s unclear how you&#39;re actually getting the above information (maybe you overrode <code>dropEvent()</code>?), but higher classes such as QTableWidget should normally override <code>dropMimeData()</code>. You need to search how the mime data is created in java, so that you can eventually unserialize it from PySide.",
