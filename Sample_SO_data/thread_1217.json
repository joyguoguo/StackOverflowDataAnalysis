    "title" : "Limiting the number of requests per minute to grpc API",
    "body" : "<p>To interact with grpc API I use java-client generated from proto-files.</p>\n<p>The used grpc API has some limit on the number of requests per minute. I would like to proactively wait for the end of the minute if the allowed number of requests has been made. I would like to avoid exceeding the allowed requests if possible and implement the corresponding logic based on a negative response from the server.</p>\n<p>How can this be done more elegantly? Perhaps there is some corresponding decorator for <code>io.grpc.Channel</code>?</p>\n",
