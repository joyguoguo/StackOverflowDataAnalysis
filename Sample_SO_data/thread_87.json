    "body" : "[1] You <b>do</b> treat it as a formal language. That makes this question mostly pointless (nobody but academia cares about that sort of thing). But, the answer is trivial: No, you do&#39;t include them. Formally, you never include local vars, no matter how important they actually are to gaining an understanding of what you&#39;re modelling/building. [2] You go with the useful, subjective definition: Stack Overflow isn&#39;t the optiomal place for such a question. We&#39;d need to know way, way more about your structure and what those variables are, and it&#39;s going to end up with a vote-to-close: Opinion.",

    "body" : "academia loves talking about &#39;class diagrams&#39;. However, in the real world, few use them, and those that do do not treat class diagrams as a formal language. Which is sensible: You can&#39;t run a class diagram, and generating code off of them is a terrible idea. Their purpose is to serve as docs. They are &#39;good&#39; if an average reader gains a correct idea of how things (are intended to) work when looking at them, and they are &#39;useless&#39; if the reader is no closer to understanding, and &#39;terrible&#39; if they mislead. But that&#39;s a subjective thing. Thus, two options, both them easy answers:",
