    "body" : "<p>I'm developing a Java Web application that uses WebSocket (javax.websocket) and want to deploy it to Apache Tomcat 9+ as a .war file.\nI use Maven to build the project and have a class annotated with @ServerEndpoint, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>@ServerEndpoint(&quot;/ws/echo&quot;)\npublic class EchoEndpoint {\n    @OnMessage\n    public String onMessage(String message) {\n        return &quot;Echo: &quot; + message;\n    }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The .war file is generated correctly, but when I deploy it to Tomcat, the WebSocket endpoint isn't registered.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions or tips for successfully deploying my project?</p>\n<p>I've already tried:\nEnsuring the @ServerEndpoint is in a scanned package.</p>\n<p>That the .war file correctly includes the compiled class.</p>\n<p>That there are no conflicts with the web.xml configuration (I left it empty).</p>\n",
