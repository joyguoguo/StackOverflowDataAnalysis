    "body" : "<p>I'm updating an old java 8 program to java 21.  I've set up my new system and most controls seem fine in scene builder except the Custom controls that appear to be from the javafx library.   In my case its the CheckBoxCombo, CheckListView, and StatusBar.</p>\n<p>On my old system using SceneBuilder I found these under Custom as in:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QxTVx7nZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QxTVx7nZ.png\" alt=\"Scenebuilder 8.5\" /></a></p>\n<p>In my updated java 21 system I've moved up to SceneBuilder 23.0.1.  These are not present so I thought I had to add them via library manager.  I browse to the javafx 21 lib folder and add in the jar files but nothing is found to be added.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8kUwRoTK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8kUwRoTK.png\" alt=\"No controls to add\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jtwsUGVF.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jtwsUGVF.png\" alt=\"missing custom option\" /></a></p>\n<p>These aren't custom controls I'm creating - just trying to load in the javafx sdk 21 controls but its not finding anything to add.</p>\n<p>Am I missing some config setting or something?    How do I get these to load into SceneBuilder?   Do I have the wrong version of SceneBuilder?</p>\n",

You must have added ControlsFX (a third-party library) to your old Scene Builder and have just forgotten that you did.

I&#39;m not too worried about the StatusBar and I think I would work around the CheckListView but the CheckComboBox might be trickier if I can&#39;t find a way (or other lib) that has a similar control.   All I&#39;m trying to do is get this up and running on 21 with minimal effort at this point.    Can I just add in the controlsfx version 8 to scene builder?   Seems like I&#39;d end up with some sort of conflict but I&#39;ll give it a shot.",
