    "body" : "<p>We want to monitor metrics on our Jakarta Batch jobs processed through JBeret.\nThat means we want to count all invocations of reader/processor/writer, all listeners, all loops executed in Batchlets and even across partitions. Such functionality is not application centric so I desire this information gathered by the framework.</p>\n<p>JBeret or the Jakarta Batch specification provides some metrics at the end of a chunk which is good but does not cover all that I need.</p>\n<p>What way is provided by JBeret to attach such functionality? Or would I have to customize JBeret, or even consider switching to another Jakarta Batch implementation that provides the metrics or extensibility?</p>\n",

The interceptor is something I need to test. <code>@BatchProperty</code> does not get injected before `@PostConstruct so it&#39;s a bit fiddely.",
