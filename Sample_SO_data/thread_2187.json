    "body" : "<p>I'm creating a report with Birt in Eclipse, and the data is collected in a POJO. The Java class that contains the data has objects within objects, but I don't know how to map this in Birt.</p>\n<p>When the class containing the data is simple, using only primitive data types, there's no problem. In the POJO, you select the getter classes and it generates the data output, but when the class is complex and has objects within objects, I'm unable to display the information.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>This would be an example of a class containing the data I need for the report. A row would be for each person, and the columns would be first name, last name, and address. However, there can be n addresses, so I'd have to iterate through them for each row. In addition, part of the address is composed of simple data and objects with more information.</p>\n<pre><code>[DATA] - class\n  [NAME] - String\n  [SUBNAME] - String\n  [ADDRESS] - Address Object\n    [NUMBER] - Integer\n    [ADDRESS_NAME] - String\n    [ADDRESS_TYPE] - Address type object\n      [TYPE_ID] - Integer\n      [NAME] - String\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've been looking for ways to interrelate each object, but honestly, I don't know much about Birt.</p>\n",
