    "body" : "<p>In my Java Spring Boot project I use Gradle for building automation. Some time ago I added a little code snippet to the <code>build.gradle</code> file that gets the version from this file and inserts it into an appropriate entry within the <code>application.yml</code> file.</p>\n<pre><code>processResources {\n    filesMatching('application.yml') {\n        expand([buildVersion: project.version]) // Match the placeholder in application.yml ($buildVersion).\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, when I run <code>./gradlew clean build</code> I get a deprecation notice <code>Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 9.0.</code>. According to <code>gradle-wrapper.properties</code> I am in use of Gradle 8.13 and Java 23. Seems this needs an update of the code segment, specifically the <code>expand</code> part. What exactly though? What must be done to essentially achieve the same thing but with updated code or logic?</p>\n",
