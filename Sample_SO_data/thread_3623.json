After doing this, even though the enum class in the new JAR file is present with exactly the same path and content as in the old JAR file, I'm getting a ClassNotFoundException.</p>\n<p>The issue occurs when the code tries to use the enum class that hasn't been initialized yet. The ClassNotFoundException happens when the existing server instance tries to use the class from the new JAR.</p>\n<p>Steps leading to the issue:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I replaced the old JAR file while the server was running.</li>\n<li>The enum class in the new JAR has the same path and content as the one in the old JAR.</li>\n<li>The class loader of the existing JAR fails to load the enum class from the new JAR, resulting in a ClassNotFoundException.</li>\n<li>This issue occurs <strong>without restarting</strong> the server after replacing the JAR.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What I want to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Even though the new JAR file has the same content and path for the\nenum class, why does the existing class loader fail to load the class\nfrom the new JAR file?</li>\n<li>What is the <strong>difference or change</strong> that causes the class\nloader to fail in this case, even though everything appears to be the\nsame from a path/content perspective?</li>\n</ul>\n",
