I tried turning the coverage off with configuration and adding the comments, like:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-ini prettyprint-override\"><code>sonar.issue.ignore.block=e2\nsonar.issue.ignore.block.e2.beginBlockRegexp=@sonar-ignore\nsonar.issue.ignore.block.e2.endBlockRegexp=@end\n</code></pre>\n<p>That didn't work, below also doesn't work after adding it to a lombok.config file:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-ini prettyprint-override\"><code>config.stopBubbling = true\nlombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any suggestions? I have other blocks of code I also want to exclude. In the UI it doesn't seem like this is possible (my preference is in the code itself).</p>\n",
