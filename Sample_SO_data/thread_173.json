    "title" : "Is Thymeleaf still maintained, and is there a Thymeleaf version compatible with Spring Boot 4 / Spring Framework 7?",
    "body" : "<p>Spring Boot <strong>4.0</strong> and Spring Framework <strong>7.0</strong> were recently released, and I’m considering upgrading my project.\nHowever, my application uses Thymeleaf, specifically the thymeleaf-spring6 integration module, which is tied to the corresponding Spring Framework major version.</p>\n<p>When checking the Thymeleaf GitHub repository, development activity for the Spring integration modules (e.g., thymeleaf-spring6) appears to be minimal in recent months/years. This raises a few questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is Thymeleaf still actively maintained?</li>\n<li>Will there be a Thymeleaf-Spring7 integration module for Spring Framework 7 / Spring Boot 4?</li>\n<li>Or is Thymeleaf effectively discontinued, meaning I should consider an alternative server-side template engine for the upgrade?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any official information or guidance from the Thymeleaf maintainers or the community would be appreciated.</p>\n",
