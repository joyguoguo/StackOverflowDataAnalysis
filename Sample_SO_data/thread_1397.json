The Activity Manager doesn't seem to allow this anymore (<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reference</a>) based on the documentation here. It appears that the methods we would use have been deprecated for security issues.</p>\n<p>Am I looking at this wrong? Or is there indeed a new way to access which apps are being used so I can then block them?</p>\n",
