I just keep going in circles trying to find a solution looking at StackOverflow and also the Android documentation.</p>\n<p>Anyone have any sample instructions / code that can receive from a boot complete broadcast and successfully run an Activity?</p>\n<p>I can confirm that my app receives the Boot Complete broadcast but fails to open the activity</p>\n<p>Here is my current BootReceiver code:</p>\n<pre><code>public class BootReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {\n\n    @Override\n    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {\n    \n        try {\n          Intent myIntent = new Intent(context, MainActivity.class);\n          myIntent.putExtra(&quot;boot&quot;, true);\n          myIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);\n          context.startActivity(myIntent);\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex) {\n          Log.i(&quot;BOOTRECEIVER&quot;, ex.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've tried the above code.\nI've tried allowing the overlay permissions from the stackoverflow link provided</p>\n",
