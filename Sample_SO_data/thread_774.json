I installed a new version of Eclipse` that does have a Java 21 compiler. But now project is complaining &quot;Release 21 is not found in the system&quot; in error logs.  Suppose I don't want to install a new JDK in my system. I want to use the one that came up with Eclipse as bundle.</p>\n<p>I checked &quot;Installed JREs&quot;. It is still binds with jdk17.</p>\n<p>Because, new Eclipse came with the bundled java 21, how to set up this bundle with Eclipse?</p>\n<p>In windows, for &quot;Installed JREs&quot; the path is something like <em>C:\\Users...p2\\pool\\plugins\\org.eclipse.justj.openjdk.hotspot.jre.full.win32.x86...</em></p>\n<p>What is the equivalent in macOS?</p>\n",

You can download JDKs from <a href=\"https://adoptium.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Adoptium</a> in .tar.gz format (or .zip for Windows), which you can then unpack to any folder you want. If you no longer need it you can simply delete it again.</p>\n<p>On my machine I have a folder with a sub folder for every LTS version (minus 25, that's coming soon on Adoptium) plus 22 to 24 for developing against some new features, and linked those in Eclipse. Works like a charm.</p>\n",

    "body" : "@Robert The Eclipse IDE packages are bundled with a full JDK, not only with a JRE (only the Eclipse Installer is bundled with a minimal JRE). The bundling is done by <a href=\"https://eclipse.dev/justj/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JustJ</a> and the Eclipse IDE 2025-09 is shipped with the full Temurin JDK 21.0.8. Be aware that the term JRE can have two meanings: either not a complete JDK (only what is needed to run it; without sources and tools needed for development) or as a generic term for both JDK and JRE. In Eclipse, you also configure JDKs in &quot;Installed JREs&quot;.",
