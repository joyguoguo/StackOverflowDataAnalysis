    "title" : "Bitbucket to GitHub migration issue of an ecs long running java batch application",
    "body" : "<p>I migrated a java ecs batch application from BitBucket to bamboo. The application is responsible for listening SQS queues and perform a task once there is a message template in the queue. During the migration process I added all workflow files related to GitHub as worker batch like ecs-worker-build, ecs-worker-deploy, ecs-worker-delete, auto-deploy etc and configured in such a way that it deploys the latest release in eng when there is a commit in feature or main brach. The workflow started working, application is deployed in eng through GitHub. It created the service in ECS and running task. Application is not listening to SQS and getting triggered even though there is a message in the queue. Application is not able to create sessions with the sqs\nPlease let me know whether anybody faced this migration issue and please find the path to the GitHub repo : <a href=\"https://github.com/Vanguard/inkind-sqs-mq-connector.batch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/Vanguard/inkind-sqs-mq-connector.batch</a></p>\n<p>I would like to know whether I missed any configuration and would like help from anybody who had faced this issue earlier and resolved the issue</p>\n",
