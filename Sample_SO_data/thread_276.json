    "body" : "<p>mlecz, record's don't have fields but instead components. These do allow <code>@Override</code>. The original code snippet compiles just fine.</p>\n<p>The way I read it, the question is two-fold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Should we use <code>@Override</code> on record components? I've seen my IDE complain that <code>@Override</code> was missing in the past, but I just checked and I don't get a warning anymore.</li>\n<li>Why does <code>javac</code> ignore <code>@Override</code> on record components? <code>javac</code> doesn't enforce them, just like it doesn't enforce them on methods. However, it doesn't give a compiler error if a record component is annotated with <code>@Override</code> incorrectly, where it does for methods. My IDE also doesn't give any errors.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The JLS is clear on <code>@Override</code> for records, see <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se25/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.6.4.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">section 9.6.4.4</a>. It explicitly states that it's <em>not</em> a compiler error if a record component is annotated with <code>@Override</code>, whether it's correct or not. I also states that the only way to enforce the semantics of <code>@Override</code> is in fact exactly what mlecz suggests.</p>\n",
