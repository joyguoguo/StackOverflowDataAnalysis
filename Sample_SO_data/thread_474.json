    "body" : "<p>Lombok developer here: There is no way to ask lombok to generate a <code>toString()</code> implementation that isn't named <code>@Override public String toString() {}</code>.</p>\n<p>In other words, impossible.</p>\n<p>Which would presumably result in a new question: Will lombok ever support such things / what would it take for lombok to add such a feature. I shall answer that too, given that &quot;no you can't&quot; with no further context would be a thoroughly uninspiring answer.</p>\n<p>I doubt we'd accept such a feature request or even a PR to add it; we'd need a thorough investigation on how useful that'd be. For example, if a bevy of non-trivial public-source projects out there could have used it, that'd be pretty much required for us to accept such a feature request.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily one could make the chicken-and-egg argument (no projects write their API with style X today because it's way too much boilerplate to do this; that's <em>why</em> it needs to be a lombok feature, so that developers can start writing their APIs in the superior-if-not-for-all-the-boilerplate style X, we'd all be better off), but I don't think there are hordes of folks who would have written toString-esque methods if only it wasn't so much boilerplate. I'm pretty sure no such argument would ever work.</p>\n<p>Just trying to be clear about what it'd take to get such a feature added to Lombok. Remember, it's a boilerplate busting tool: If a tiny minority of people would use the heck out of a feature but the rest of the ecosystem never would, it doesn't matter that it'd be ridiculously useful to you and your small group; that's not &quot;boilerplate&quot;, at least not the way lombok defines it.</p>\n",
