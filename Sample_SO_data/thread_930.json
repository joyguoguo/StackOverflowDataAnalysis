    "body" : "Re: &quot;<i>the above is the easiest possible thing to read</i>&quot; -- whether all the types and qualifiers of a bunch of declarations are the same is rarely the information I want to be most readily accessible.  Instead, I almost always want to know what the type and qualifiers are for one or more <i>particular</i> declarations, and for that, I want each declaration to declare exactly one identifier.  That&#39;s what&#39;s easiest for me to read.  Because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s where you intend to focus, I have edited the question to reduce the likelihood of a (further) diversion in that direction.",
