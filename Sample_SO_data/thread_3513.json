    "body" : "<p>I’m building a custom browser in my Android application and need to take a screenshot of each tab when a web page loads.</p>\n<p>Currently, I’m using the following method to capture the screenshot:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public Bitmap tabScreenShot(Context context) {\n    WebView webView = new WebView(context);\n    return new Screenshot().takeWebView(webView, height, width);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>\uD83D\uDCDD <strong>Issue 1: Blank Space in Screenshot</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>If the loaded web page has content only on the top half and the bottom half is blank (white space), the screenshot captures this blank space as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This results in an undesirable half-white page, which doesn’t look visually appealing when generating thumbnails for the tabs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\uD83D\uDCDD <strong>Issue 2: Capturing the Visible View After Scrolling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In some cases, users scroll the page to the bottom (into the white space area).\nWhen this happens, the screenshot captures whatever is currently shown in the WebView, which is just a blank space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\uD83C\uDFAF Goal:\nI want to modify the screenshot behavior to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Capture a screenshot for a given height and width.</li>\n<li>Always capture the screenshot starting from the top-left corner of the loaded webpage, regardless of the scroll position.</li>\n<li>Minimize or completely avoid capturing unnecessary blank space at the bottom.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By doing this, I aim to minimize the amount of blank/white space captured, thereby improving the visual quality of the generated thumbnails.</p>\n<p>❓ Questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is there a way to capture a screenshot starting from the top-left corner of the WebView’s content, even if the user scrolls down to the bottom?</li>\n<li>Can I force the WebView to scroll to the top programmatically before taking the screenshot to avoid capturing unwanted blank space?</li>\n<li>Is there an alternative approach that ensures a clean, well-cropped screenshot from the top of the webpage?</li>\n</ol>\n",
