    "title" : "Application migration to Websphere Liberty",
    "body" : "<p>I am migrating an application to liberty based. the application is servlet based and Jsp files based. I have created dockerfiles, helm chart and liberty config files like server.xml. my application is packed with its own set of JARs required. I am using parentLast delegation to isolate application from liberty interference.</p>\n<p>Current Error:</p>\n<p>Caused by: java.lang.LinkageError. loading constraint violation when resolving method &quot;org/eclipse/ equinox/servletbridge/BridgeServl et.registerServletDelegate(Ljavax/ servlet/http/HttpServlet;)V&quot;: loader &quot;org/eclipse/osgi/internal/baseadaptor /DefaultClassLoader@d66d27b2&quot; of class &quot;org/eclipse/equinox/http/ servletbridge/internal/Activator&quot; and loader &quot;com/ibm/ws/classloading/internal /ParentLastClassLoader@fc9bb2bd&quot; of class &quot;org/eclipse/equinox/servletbridge/ BridgeServlet&quot; have different types for the method signature.</p>\n<p>Root Cause: Liberty servlet-3.0 feature provides HttpServlet (servlet 3.1 API) to parent classloader, while embedded javax.servlet_3.0.0 bundle provides HttpServlet (servlet 3.0 API) to OSGi bundles. Same class name, DIFFERENT Class objects = LinkageError!</p>\n<p>For ERROR : I have tried 3 ways:</p>\n<p>-&gt; one is keeping servlet feature and removing servlet bundle from packing but it causes HTTPServlet and GenericServlet classes not found error.</p>\n<p>-&gt; another is keeping servlet bundle and removing servlet feature but it causes application to not start as liberty requires servlet features to deploy WARs</p>\n<p>-&gt; when i keep both of them - causes linkage error as mentioned above.</p>\n",
