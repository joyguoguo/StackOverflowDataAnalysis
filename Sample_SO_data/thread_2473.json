    "body" : "<p>Is there an alternative to setXORMode in Java to do reversible graphics?  I need to draw lines or rectangles, then redraw over them to undo them. AlphaComposite.Xor doesn't do it. A full repaint while the user is dragging a line/rectangle would be possible but painful.</p>\n<p>Motivation: I'm plagued by the huge performance hit after using setXORMode reported by Wolf a while back (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48990549/java2d-performance-issue-after-using-setxormodecolor-c\">Java2D performance issue after using setXORMode(Color c)</a>). The problem isn't the performance of the XORMode itself; it's that a single call to setXORMode corrupts something, such that subsequent graphics calls remain achingly slow for the lifetime of the component. (Only in Windows; macOS no problem.)</p>\n<p>[using Windows 11, Oracle JDK24]</p>\n",
