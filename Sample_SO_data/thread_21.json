    "title" : "Representing 4 types of Card Templates Adhering to DDD",
    "body" : "<p>I have an Entity Called CardTemplate. For physical cards, there will have to be a pattern chosen to physically print the card. And based on the two types of operations that the cards are allowed to do, the templates must also have a range of possible card numbers as a property if the cards are going to be used for banking operations (operation type1) and no range is needed otherwise(operation type 2). So we will have 4 types of cards: physical with operation type 1, physical with operation type 2, virtual with operation type 1, and virtual with operation type 2.</p>\n<p>How can I represent these in code while implementing the rules for each type of card? I first thought of having 4 types, but what if there were another IF (if the card is x then y)? We will then have to have 8 types</p>\n",
