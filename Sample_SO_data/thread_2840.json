    "title" : "How do you resummon the &quot;Build Scripts Found&quot; notification that appears when first importing a new project?",
    "body" : "<p>When importing a project by directory into IntelliJ IDEA, if it contains maven pom.xml files, a notification appears in the bottom right that allows all of the pom.xml files in the project directories to be loaded at once. However, if it's dismissed or IntelliJ is restarted before clicking this button, the only way I've found to cause it to appear again is to clear the .idea cache, restart IntelliJ, and reimport the project.</p>\n<p>When attempting to import Maven projects afterwards, the only way to do so is by selecting them one at a time, which is a pain due to the large number of nested Maven projects in our repository and our project's lack of a top-level pom.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to resummon this pop-up or use its functionality without invalidating IntelliJ caches or reimporting the project from scratch?</p>\n",
