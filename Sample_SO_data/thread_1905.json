    "title" : "Mutual exclusive toggles with the Togglz library",
    "body" : "<p>We are using the <a href=\"https://www.togglz.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Togglz library</a> to implement the Feature Toggles pattern in one of our projects. It works as designed for boolean options. However, in certain cases we rather want to switch between three or even more properties that are <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> and can't be mapped to a single boolean switch.</p>\n<p>Are there any built-in features or extensions for the Togglz library to have one toggle disable other toggles (maybe within the same <code>@FeatureGroup</code>)? I do understand that this requirement goes beyond the idea of having (boolean) toggles, but maybe there's an option for that.</p>\n<p><strong>For a practical example, think of something like this:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>public enum MyToggles implements Feature {\n\n  @FeatureGroup(&quot;Quality&quot;)\n  LOW,\n\n  @FeatureGroup(&quot;Quality&quot;)\n  @EnabledByDefault\n  MEDIUM,\n\n  @FeatureGroup(&quot;Quality&quot;)\n  HIGH;\n\n  [...]\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>These toggles should never be enabled at the same time. Turning one of them to <code>true</code> should switch all the other toggles to <code>false</code>. I've checked the documentation, but I couldn't find any such feature. At the same time I imagine, that we might not be the first ones who might have such a requirement.</p>\n",
