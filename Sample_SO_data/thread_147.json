    "title" : "m2e Workspace Resolution Broken After Upgrading from Eclipse 2021 to 2025",
    "body" : "<p>I’m upgrading an old Eclipse setup and ran into a strange issue with m2e workspace resolution.</p>\n<p>I moved from <strong>Eclipse 2021</strong> to <strong>Eclipse 2025</strong>.<br />\nI created a completely clean Eclipse installation and workspace, imported all my projects, and installed all required plugins.</p>\n<p>However, I now have this problem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Project A has a Maven dependency on Project B (declared in A's pom.xml)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If Project B is open in the workspace, then Project A cannot resolve imports or references to Project B</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If Project B is closed, then Project A compiles fine (but now under Maven Dependencies the jar of Project B is present, not the project folder)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If I disable &quot;Resolve dependencies from workspace projects&quot; in Project A it also works, but this slows down development, as I have to build Project B after each change for Project A to pick up the changes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So workspace resolution itself seems broken.</p>\n<p>Edit: I have tried updating maven projects (Alt + f5) and cleaning repeatedly and I have an external maven installation configured. The errors I see are both in the code itself, and in the problems view of eclipse. I am not using code generation.</p>\n",
