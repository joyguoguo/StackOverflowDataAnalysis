Or am I missing something?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n",

    "body" : "<p>I think it's just a historical accident. There were options like <code>ScanQuery</code> and <code>SqlQuery</code>, neither of which support joins, so it would make sense to fire them at a specific table. Then the SQL engine was added and <code>SqlFieldsQuery</code> was added, and it inherits from <code>Query</code> so it (kind of) makes sense to also execute it against a table.</p>\n<p>You'll notice that thin-clients have a <a href=\"https://ignite.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/ignite/client/IgniteClient.html#query(org.apache.ignite.cache.query.SqlFieldsQuery)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">query method at the top level</a> rather than at the table level, and Ignite 3 has a top level <code>ignite.sql()</code>, so different choices were made when the option was available.</p>\n",
