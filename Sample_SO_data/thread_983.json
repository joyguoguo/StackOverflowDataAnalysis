I didn&#39;t do any tests to see if JavaFX gets some of its info on how to scroll from the &quot;natural scrolling&quot; setting in the OS, so it may or may not, depending on how sophisticated the scrolling behavior implementation is.",

Years ago, before devices with touch screens were commonplace, the behavior you describe might have felt more intuitive. (and to be fair, I haven&#39;t used a mouse wheel in years, perhaps in decades.)",
