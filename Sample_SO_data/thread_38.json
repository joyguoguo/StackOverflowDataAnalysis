I have one superclass and three subclasses, which inherit attributes from the superclass, and each subclass has its own specific attribute. I need to implement filtering with any combination of parameters (using Specifications). I’m not sure how to apply the Strategy pattern here.</p>\n<p>I tried something like having a <code>VehicleSpecification(name, power)</code> and, for example, <code>BikeSpecification(name, power, size)</code>, <code>TankSpecification(name, power, pipeLength)</code>, and maybe some interface for this, but honestly, I’m not sure. Here comes the question of the <code>BikeService</code>, where I don’t know how to structure everything so that it works with the Strategy design pattern.</p>\n",

(or is this a CS/SE homework assignment?)</p>\n<p>Also, please clarify exactly what you mean by &quot;specification&quot; here, because <em>I think</em> you mean &quot;specialization&quot;, but I'm uncertain. And what is your <code>BikeService</code>?</p>\n<p><sub>I noticed you're using Java - which by-virtue of the limited expressiveness of its type-system, means <a href=\"https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition/tree/uinverse/src/main/java/com/seriouscompany/business/java/fizzbuzz/packagenamingpackage/impl/strategies\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">people (and Enterprises) tend to overuse design-patterns</a> (even worse: those GoF design-patterns were designed for languages with richer conceptions of OOP like C++ and Smalltalk, hence the pain).</sub></p>\n",
