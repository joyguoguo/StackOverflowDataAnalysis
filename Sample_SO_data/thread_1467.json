When I was tinkering with the system I noticed the socketio java client is getting disconnected every few seconds from the socketio javascript server that I am using for hello world relay server.</p>\n<p>I have a device setup to talk to the server but I noticed after 25 to 75 seconds it gets disconnected. I have everything in default settings.\nI thought socket io server will be good enough as an alternative to firebase but I am not getting reliable connection with this:</p>\n<pre><code> socket = IO.socket(uri, opts).also { s -&gt;\n            s.on(Socket.EVENT_CONNECT) { ...\n            s.on(Socket.EVENT_DISCONNECT) { ... // after few seconds its state is disconnected.\n</code></pre>\n<p>client version:</p>\n<pre><code>implementation(&quot;io.socket:socket.io-client:2.1.1&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>server version:</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;socket.io&quot;: &quot;^4.8.1&quot;,\n</code></pre>\n<p>server:</p>\n<pre><code>const io  = new Server(app, { cors: { origin: '*' } });\n\nio.on('connection', socket =&gt; {...} // on message... etc. simple hello world server. \n</code></pre>\n",

    "body" : "&quot;So network condition is not the primary fact.&quot;  - Probably not.  But it is still subject to some kinds of networking-related functionality; e.g. <code>iptables</code> on Linux.  But either way, you need to figure out why the connections are getting disconnected.  If you think this is a programming problem and you want people to help you debug it, you need to provide a minimal reproducible example.",
