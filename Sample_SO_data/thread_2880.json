    "body" : "<p>I'm automating a website, but this website takes the session of the logged-in user via SSO. If I'm already logged in to the email and I access the page, it automatically takes me to the dashboard. However, if I'm not logged in and I access the page, it redirects me to a login page. It completes the login process and redirects me back to the page I entered. This login has a username, a password, and a mobile code, which is entered. In my authorization, I've completed the manual login process, and it saves data such as cookies, local storage, and session storage. It saves it correctly when I open the browser and load the cookie and local storage data. Session storage doesn't allow me to redirect directly to the login because the website and login domains are different. Could you help me with how I can maintain the logged-in user's session and continue executing the authorization?</p>\n",
