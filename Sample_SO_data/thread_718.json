    "title" : "Upgrading to Tahoe 26.0.1 fails Java execution",
    "body" : "<p>I upgraded my MacOS to Tahoe 26.0.1 yesterday. Since that my Java application fails. Got to the bottom and found below command is being executed.</p>\n<pre><code>Runtime.getRuntime().exec(&quot;open OutFile.pdf&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I try in the command line <code>open OutFile.pdf</code> it works fine, and perfectly opens the PDF on Apple Preview.</p>\n<p>My question is what might be the issue where through pragmatic form it no longer works?</p>\n<p>I tried giving the full path, yet seem to not work.</p>\n<p>Now the matter of the fact is that there's a step where this PDF generates prior to opening like this. I just now found out that if I open a PDF separately in a command like this it still works.</p>\n<p>So that means something around the threading in JDK/OS may have changed. Because I don't use any threads in my code.</p>\n<p>A small change in the code shows that the open function fails here. Next need to get to the reason behind that.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{&quot;open&quot;, outFile});\nint success = proc.waitFor();\nif (success != 0) {\n    System.out.println(&quot;Failed to open file: &quot; + outFile);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'll post more details of the analysis as I dig deeper with your comments below.</p>\n",

    "body" : "<h2>Fragile code</h2>\n<p>That call would be dependent on [A] the current working directory -of your java process- to be the same directory that contains <code>OutFile.pdf</code>. Eliminate this caveat by always supplying an absolute path, and [B] <code>open</code> being on the system path <em>in a way that the JVM understands</em> which is similar to A extremely fragile so do not do that.</p>\n<p>In other words, execute instead:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Runtime.getRuntime().exec(&quot;/usr/bin/open /absolute/path/to/OutFile.pdf&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Use java to create that absolute path if you want.</p>\n<h2>MacOS security infra</h2>\n<p>Apple's infrastructure for security might be involved here. If an application attempts to open e.g. a PDF on the desktop, <em>that will not work</em> until you give that app the rights to access the desktop. You get a popup to grant that right, but if you click 'deny', that's that. How java is dealt with depends on how you installed the JVM and how  you ran the java app. Sometimes it's your shell (zsh or bash usually) that's the &quot;app of record&quot;, more usually its java (the JVM executable) itself, but it can also be your IDE or your app (i.e. your jar). You can check in your System Preferences under 'Privacy &amp; Security' and then sections such as &quot;Files and Folders&quot;. Is your app in there, and does it have any of the switches set to the left (grayed out / dark)? Set them to the right.</p>\n<h2>Something else</h2>\n<p>That's the best guess given limited context. If you're still running into trouble, then include in your question the exact errors you get.</p>\n",
