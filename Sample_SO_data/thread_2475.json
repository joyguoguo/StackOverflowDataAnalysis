    "body" : "<p>I am having difficulty accessing student java files/projects. When I open the files I am always asked to run with an ANT build (don't know what that means) and it will not run. If I copy the code and create a new project it works fine, so there is nothing wrong with code, but I want to be able to open and run students work directly.\nI have looked at another question about this but did not understand any of the answers. Can anyone provide any direction please?</p>\n<p>I have tried opening the files and it asks for an ANT build. I have created a new project and opened the file into the new project, and again was asked for the ANT build. I have copied the code into a new black project and file and everything works.</p>\n<p>I am accessing the files by simply going to File--&gt;Open File and selecting the files that I want. They are all Java files.\nThis is a picture of tree on the left and code headings across the top.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Boj7LDzu.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Boj7LDzu.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n",
