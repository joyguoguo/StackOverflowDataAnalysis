    "title" : "Launch a java jar downloaded locally, as it if was run from a web browser?",
    "body" : "<p>Is it possible to launch a local jar as if it was run directly from a web browser.  Is there some way to pass the URL as a variable to it to make it think it was?</p>\n<p>It seems that java jar's don't work properly if downloaded and run locally, rather than being run from the web browser.  Is this just because one or a few variables (-D x=y) aren't set if run locally?  Can this been worked-around?  The error messages don't give me enough info to see where to start.</p>\n<p>I have to deal with many old bits of enterprise gear where the web server doesn't use modern TLS/SSL ciphers, needs embedded java, or similar.  I've had pretty good luck with keeping a couple old versions of Firefox installed in parallel, pointed to a couple old java versions, modifying security settings as needed, but I still run into some issues, and it would really help to be able to run locally with just java without needing an old browser.</p>\n<p>If I try to run a JAR from the URL:</p>\n<p>./j2sdk1.4.2_19/bin/java -jar 'https://192.168.1.4/main.jar'</p>\n<p>Unable to access jarfile <a href=\"https://192.168.1.4/main.jar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://192.168.1.4/main.jar</a></p>\n<p>If I try to run a downloaded JAR:</p>\n<p>./j2sdk1.4.2_19/bin/java -jar main.jar</p>\n<p>GUI: &quot;Invalid server address&quot;</p>\n",
