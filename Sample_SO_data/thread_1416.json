The specific problem is also noted there. The Maven build does not fail if a scenario fails.  And the shortest code is present as a simple example. Since this is a build setup that requires some file in a directory structure, sharing a repo link is useful. Yes, it is a link, and the latest commit may change. But the original problem will not change, it is a Git repo with history.",
