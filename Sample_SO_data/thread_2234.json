    "title" : "Java gRPC - Single Channel with multiple DNS of same backend",
    "body" : "<p>Different instances of the same backend I want to use in my gRPC Channel are hosted in different AWS regions with different DNS. I want to pass in all these different DNS at the time of Channel creation, probably something like this -</p>\n<pre><code>ManagedChannelBuilder.forTarget(&quot;multi-endpoint://dns1.com;dns2.com;dns3.com&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, I want to write an implementation of the NameResolver interface that gRPC provides, to do the name resolution individually for the three DNS. However, it works only if the serviceAuthority is same across all the DNS.</p>\n<p>My questions are -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Should I even be creating a single Channel with multiple DNS? Is it anti-pattern?</li>\n<li>Is it possible to create a single Channel with multiple DNS and have it work when serviceAuthorities are different?</li>\n<li>Should I create multiple Channels, one for each DNS?</li>\n</ol>\n",
