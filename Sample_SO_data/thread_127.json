    "body" : "<p>Context: I am trying to build a Spring Boot application and have exposed a REST api endpoint to upload files(as large as 1 GB).</p>\n<p>Question: Since the data transfer for a multipart file happens in chunks and is continuous, what would happen if I explicitly delay reading from the MultiPartFile stream? Would the input stream continue to receive data from the client side and fill the server's memory, or would it stop after a certain time and wait for the input to be read before pulling in more data?</p>\n",
