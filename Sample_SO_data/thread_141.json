    "body" : "<p>I'm working on a JavaFX application that requires Java 17+, which only supports 64-bit operating systems. I'm using the <code>launch4j-maven-plugin</code> to create an EXE file, and I need to ensure that when users click the EXE, it checks if they're running a 64-bit OS before attempting to launch the JVM.</p>\n<p>The challenge is that this detection logic cannot be written in Java code since Java 17 won't run at all on 32-bit systems. I need a way to implement this check at the native wrapper level before the JVM even starts.</p>\n<p>What approaches are available with launch4j to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Detect the operating system architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit) at the native level</li>\n<li>Show a custom error message if the system is 32-bit</li>\n<li>Prevent the JVM from attempting to start on incompatible systems</li>\n</ol>\n",
